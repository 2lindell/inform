Inform build 6M62 (14 December 2015)

Command line: -log=X is now -log X

Limit on quoted text length raised to 8K

Limit on object name length removed

Options.txt now encoded as UTF-8, not ISO Latin-1

Adjective grading improved:
	big -> bigger, biggest
And "long" to "length"

In text substitutions, a local variable name is preferred over an adaptive
verb; e.g. if "index" is both.
