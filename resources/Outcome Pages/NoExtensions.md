# Details Not Yet Available

This part of the Inform application ordinarily displays the extensions which are
installed into the current project. A catalogue of those is made every time the
project is translated, and also every time an extension is added. That seems not
to have happened yet, so no catalogue is available. Try clicking Go and look
again, or else install an extension using the menus.
