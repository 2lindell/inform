# The Public Library is Disconnected

This tab normally holds a public library of extensions shared by Inform authors,
but right now it's **disconnected**.

It's possible that the Inform website is down, and if so then our apologies:
please try again later.

It's possible that your computer is not currently connected to the Internet, and
if so, please try again when you're back online.

Though this is less likely, it's also possible that you're behind a firewall
which is for some reason blocking the traffic. But since Inform is only making a
regular Internet connection, not using an unusual port, it's more likely to be
for one of the reasons above.
