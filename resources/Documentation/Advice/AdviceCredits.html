<p>Inform is a team effort kept alive by the enthusiasm of a community of writers.</p>
<p>The core software is by Graham Nelson, and the Examples and much of the design by Emily Short, with advice from Andrew Plotkin and others.</p>
<p>The Mac OS X application was originally written by Andrew Hunter, and was rewritten in 2014 by Toby Nelson, building on Andrew's foundations. Corresponding apps for Windows and Linux are by David Kinder and Philip Chimento, and command-line tools for Linux, on a variety of processors, are maintained by Adam Thornton. David also maintains the Inform 6 code base, now used as a code-generator within Inform 7.</p>
<p>Many people have generously shared their Extensions to Inform, and they're credited individually. But special thanks are due to Mark Musante, Zed Lopez, Dannii Willis, Erik Temple, Aaron Reed, Ron Newcomb, Eric Eve and Juhana Leinonen for work on the Public Library and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Literally thousands of people have filed bug reports or suggestions over the years. If you're one of them, sincere thanks to YOUR NAME HERE. Inform would never have got this far without you.</p>
<p>The Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation (IFTF), a non-profit
organisation working on behalf of the community, has done an enormous
amount to bring people and resources together. Inform is not strictly
speaking an IFTF project, but if you like using Inform and would
like to make a donation to help things along, please donate to IFTF.</p>
