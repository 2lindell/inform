<p>Between 2016 and 2022, Inform was rewritten from top to bottom, and prepared
for open-sourcing: that is, for being published as free software which anybody
can inspect, fix bugs in, or contribute to. The software changed enormously
as a result, seen from the inside, but for users it remains almost the same
(except for hundreds of bug fixes).</p>

<p>There are exceptions to this, however, for users who mix their Inform source
text with low-level I6 code using "Include (- ... -)". Very few users do this
themselves, but it's more common to make use of extensions which do. Quite a
few popular extensions have needed to be rewritten for the version 10 Inform,
and you may therefore need to update your copies of them. The Public Library
in this app may be a good place to start.</p>

<p>The archive of release notes for Inform, detailing essentially every change
since 2006, can be found at <b>https://github.com/ganelson/inform</b>.<p>
