  Crew Lounge
  Deliberately spartan: the crew feels weight restrictions here first, so there aren't any chairs, just a few thin pads on the ground.
  
  The one major source of entertainment is the holographic projector, a top of the line Misthon 9000, on which you view every beam you can get.
  
  You can also see Lewis and Harper here.
