  Entrevaux Station
  The station building consists of a waiting room and a ticket-selling office so small that only one person can buy a ticket at a time. On the outside wall is a clock that runs twelve minutes late; but since the trains also run twelve minutes, give or take, behind their published schedule, this clock is helpful in establishing reasonable expectations.
  
  Painted on the door is the logo of the Chemin de Fer de Provence, the only railway in France that is not part of the SNCF.
  
  The "train" on which you arrived is really just a single car, more like a trolley than a proper train.
  
  Milling about one end of the station is a crowd of medieval re-enactors.

  They're dressed in a somewhat aimless range of styles roughly honoring the period of 900-1500 AD. One gentleman is wearing a knobby leather cap; which is a good thing, because there is a rooster standing on his head.
