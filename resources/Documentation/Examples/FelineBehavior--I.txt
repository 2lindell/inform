  Time passes.
  
  The cat laps up the cream.
  
  Good thing you have no use for the quantity of cream yourself.

  Time passes.
  
  The cat makes the ball of wool into a useless tangle which must be discarded.
  
  Good thing you have no use for the ball of wool yourself.
  
  >[3] open bag
  You open the bag, revealing catnip.
  
  The cat frolics with the catnip until nothing remains of it.
  
  Good thing you have no use for catnip yourself.
  
  >[4] z
  Time passes.
  
  The cat bats playfully at the newspaper until all the nasty boring articles are destroyed.
  
  Good thing you have no use for the newspaper yourself.
  
  >[5] z
  Time passes.
  
  The cat looks miffed at the lack of ready entertainment, and glares at you with yellow eyes as though wondering whether your pants leg is good for claw-sharpening.
