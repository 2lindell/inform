  Back Garden
  It is a beautiful day just at the end of spring and beginning of summer. The sun shines, the trees blossom, the world conspires in Edenic cheerfulness. You can take in none of it. Your eye is on the delicate, valuable copy of The Last Man - which is in the ziploc bag - which is in the pond.
