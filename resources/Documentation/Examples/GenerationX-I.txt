  Volunteer Center
  A fairly spartan office, though there are a few attractive posters from advertising campaigns of the past, and an ominous map charting the deforestation of Brazil.
  
  On the desk are a pile of leaflets, a pile of business cards and a power stapler.
  
  Your daughter Jenna is here, barely visible through the cloud of resentment.
  
  You can also see a cardboard box (closed) here.

  "Look, if I have to be here doing dumb stuff, could you at least tell me to do stuff that isn't already done?" Jenna asks wearily.
  
  >[12] jenna, take desk
  "Maybe you should've brought someone a little stronger," Jenna says. "Like the Incredible Hulk."
  
  >[13] jenna, open box
  Jenna gives a great upward sigh, riffling her bangs. "Once again... there is totally no point."
