  (To communicate in The Cheese-makers, TALK TO a character.)
  
  >[5] talk to me
  There will be plenty of occasion for muttered asides later in the play, but for now you must prepare the audience for things to come.
  
  >[6] talk to audience
  Drawing breath, you turn to the audience, and offer them a genial, witty, colorful, and of course crude synopsis of what they are about to see; describing all the characters in unmistakable terms and not omitting the most important of them all, your august self.
  
  The chorus now begins its entry, accompanying with anapestic song its march up the eisodos.
  
  >[7] g
  You may only direct monologues to the audience when the other actors are off-stage. Otherwise, their characters might have to notice.
  
  The chorus draws nearer, stomping and clomping and swinging their baskets of cheese.
  
  >[8] talk to chorus
  Sssh: this moment belongs to the chorus. They've worked so hard on it, after all.
  
  You stand aside as the chorus fills the orchestra and dances to and fro.
  
  >[9] look
  Theater of Dionysus
  The chorus are dancing and singing their way into position in the orchestra. The audience appear to be pricing their costumes to the nearest obol: woe to the producer who cheats them of their due share of spectacle.
  
  The tune of the aulos-player grows more and more frenzied and then breaks off.
  
  The chorus falls silent, which is the cue: Heracles bursts out of the scene building.
  
  >[10] x heracles
  Hard to mistake in his lion skin and boots, and carrying a formidable club.
  
  With a fart and a roar, Heracles asks the world at large, and you in particular, where his dinner might be.
  
  >[11] talk to me
  "By the dog, he'll eat me if he gets a chance," you mutter aside.
  
  "What's that you say, my ignoble friend?" demands Heracles, hefting his club. He's not entirely joking: you've left the script just now.
  
  >[12] talk to audience

  >[13] z
  Time passes.
  
  In epic diction, Heracles invites the dairy-mistresses, whey-matrons, and concubines of curd to supply him a supper from their ample baskets.
  
  >[14] look
  Theater of Dionysus
  Heracles stands at the center of the orchestra, with members of the chorus ranged on either side.
  
  The audience appear to be reserving their judgement, though they show signs of restiveness at the usual jokes: must there be a Heracles in every play?
  
  Heracles and the chorus banter about the proclivities of cheese-wives. The chorus suggest that Heracles, as a son of Zeus, must know something about the appetites of which they speak.
  
  >[15] talk to heracles
  "Dear Heracles, friendly Heracles," you begin, cringing out of the way as he responds with one of his affectionate ox-killing punches to the shoulder.
  
  But Heracles falls still, and looks almost thoughtful, as tell him you know how he may rout the Spartans, woo all twenty-four lactic ladies, and tame his savage gut with a bathtubful of porridge.
  
  "Speak on, little man," he says.
  
  >[16] g
  It takes several exchanges for him to wrap his one-inch brain around your ten-inch plan; but in the end he embraces the scheme, the women, and your humble self.
  
  That, of course, is your cue: you're to come back on as Pan thirty verses from now, and it takes time to put on the hooves and the woolly-legged trousers.
  
  
  
      *** You exit ***
  
  
  
  Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?
