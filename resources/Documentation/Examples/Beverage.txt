* Removing things from play
(DRINKing a potion which then goes away--Liquid container removed when drunk; Beverage Service)
A potion that the player can drink.

Some kinds of game objects -- food, for instance -- can only sensibly be used once, and should then be destroyed. The EAT command already implements this, but suppose we also had a category of drinkable potions:

	{*}"Beverage Service"

	A potion is a kind of thing. The sparkly blue potion is a potion carried by the player.

	Level 3 is a room.

	Instead of drinking a potion (called the drink):
		now the drink is nowhere;
		say "You quaff [the drink]. It goes down beautifully."
		
	Test me with "drink sparkly / i".
