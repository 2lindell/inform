^^{Suspend and resume text input}

Sometimes you may want to say something while waiting for the player's input, such as in a timer event. But if you say something while text input is active, the interpreter will raise a error. Before doing so you must suspend text input in the window, and then resume again afterwards.

	{*}"Disaster"
	
	The Control Room is a room. "Alarms are blaring everywhere!"
	
	Glk event handling rule for a timer event:
		suspend text input in the main window;
		say "[line break]
			[one of]That high pitched bell goes off again!
			[or]You hear a deep rumble underground.
			[or]All the lights on the console briefly flash at once, before the screens turn off.
			
			After a brief moment they return. Concerning.
			[at random]

		resume text input in the main window;
	
	To request timer events every (N - number) milliseconds:
		(- glk_request_timer_events({N}); -).
	
	When play begins:
		request timer events every 5000 milliseconds;
