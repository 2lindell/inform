  Ginger Beer Factory
  In the center of the room is an enormous pot filled with crushed ginger, which seems to be bubbling slightly on its own.  The fumes are overwhelming.
  
  There is a large glass lense propped against the wall, in which are reflected all the contents of the room.

  Storeroom
  The walls here are lined with a prodigious number of small, rounded bottles, each with a screw top and a smiling pirate on the label.
  
  There is a small glass lense sitting on the floor.  Due to some curious effect of the optics, it appears to be giving a view of somewhere else entirely.
  
  >[3] examine lense
  A gleaming lense about the size of a pound coin.
  
  >[4] look through lense

  You peer into the little lense and through it see, in the Ginger Beer Factory, the pot.
