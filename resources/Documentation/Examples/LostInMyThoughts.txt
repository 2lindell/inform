^^{Handle Glk timer events}

While Inform does track the time of day, it doesn't, by default, show the time in the status line. So we'll first set that up.

	{*}"Lost In My Thoughts"
	
	Lost in my thoughts is a room. "All day long I sit here, lost in my thoughts."
	
	When play begins:
		now the right hand status line is "Time: [time of day]".

Inform doesn't come with support for making timer events out of the box, but it's easy to add a phrase calling the function:

	{**}To request timer events every (N - number) milliseconds:
		(- glk_request_timer_events({N}); -).

Now all we need to do is create an event handler, and then start the timer:

	{**}Glk event handling rule for a timer event:
		increase the time of day by 1 minute;
		redraw the status line;
	
	When play begins:
		request timer events every 500 milliseconds;
