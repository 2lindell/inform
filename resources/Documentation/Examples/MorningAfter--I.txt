  Red Door Saloon
  This old place is in pretty bad shape since the mine shut down. Now there's not much to see but the pair of deep gouges in the floorboards where they dragged away the Sheriff's corpse with the spurs still on.
  
  At 8:30 AM the only person around is old Jed, collecting his hangover cure.
  
  You can also see a pistol and a hangover cure here.

  pistol: Taken.
  hangover cure: Taken. Two yellow egg-yolks unbroken in a red-brown liquid. Yep.
