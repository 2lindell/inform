  Fallow Field
  The very land is gloomy, the earth plowed into untended rows that yield no fruit, shadowed by the castle to the north. A chasm, no doubt the product of some upheaval of the earth, opens before your feet.
  
  The hempen rope is tied to the oak stump, and from there runs off towards the Chasm.

  Chasm
  Your person is most uncomfortably pressed on every side by the closeness of the walls; to which you may add as a further inconvenience, that the irregularity of the floor making it difficult to walk upright.

  Castle Hall
  All is desolate: the great hall has no roof, nor is there any glass in the windows. A staircase without banister ascends inside the wall to a musician's gallery without song.
  
  >[11] up
  
  Musician's Gallery
  Of its former cheery aspect only this remains to the Gallery: that chevrons of red and yellow are painted on the wall. But as these are streaked with rain and grime, the banister pulled away, the roof open to the sky, and the corners made a nesting place for birds, the consolation thereby afforded is but slight.
  
  A pointed door of particularly grim and uninviting aspect leads north.
  
  >[12] unlock pointed door with key
  You unlock the pointed door.
  
  >[13] open it
  When you rattle at the door, there arises from beyond a terrible shrill noise as though something beyond exults in its imminent release.
  
  >[14] tie rope to door
  You loop the hempen rope around the pointed door and knot firmly.
  
  >[15] down
