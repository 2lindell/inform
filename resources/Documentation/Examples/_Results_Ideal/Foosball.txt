  An Interactive Fiction
  Release 1 / Serial number 150512 / Inform 7 build 6M22 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD
  
  Lounge
  The Lounge is appointed with everything necessary to rest and relaxation: a vending machine, a potted palm, a stack of Entertainment Weekly issues from 1993, and -- your pride and joy -- a foosball game.
  
  On the foosball game is a small white ball (still).
  
  Joey is hunkered over the foosball handles on his side of the table.
