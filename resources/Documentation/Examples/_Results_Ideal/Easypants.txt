   Wedding Chapel Dressing Room
  From the other side of the door, you hear the organist move on from his instrumental interpretation of "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" to a somewhat more spirited rendition of "Help! I Need Somebody!". Okay, okay, but you've been rushing things along since the 16th fairway, and you can't be more than a half-hour late... Surely that mother of hers can't blame you for that?

  Wedding Chapel Dressing Room
  The bride's dressing room is a lavish suite with closets, hangers, dressmaker's dummies, boxes of straight pins and sewing notions, combs, lotions, brushes, and hair fixatives, plus room for  fifteen female attendants and a photographer. Before they shoved you out of the room you even got a glimpse of a small reference library including "1001 French Braids" and "Corset-Lacing For Beginners."
  
  This is the groom's dressing room. You get a framed photograph of Elvis, a dusty mirror, and the floor space of an average toilet stall.
