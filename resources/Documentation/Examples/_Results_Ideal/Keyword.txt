  Empyrean Shuttle Bay
  From here you have an excellent view of the colony world, which looks... well, it looks discouragingly orange. But terraforming is in progress.
  
  Your shuttle awaits.
  
  You can also see Aunt Martha and a stack of rations here.

  >[1] martha, get in the shuttle
  "Shuttles! I hate shuttles," Aunt Martha grumbles. "Give me an airplane! AIRPLANE."
  
  >[2] martha, for pity's sake, do you see an airplane around here?
  "Those were the days," Aunt Martha agrees, plainly reliving the days when she wore a blue-and-white uniform and passed out packets of salted pretzels.
  
  >[3] martha, pass me the rations
  "Do you think there are any peanuts in there?" she asks in a wistful tone.
