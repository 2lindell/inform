  Alcove
  You are in an alcove. A small northwest path seems to widen after a short distance. An extremely tight tunnel leads east. It looks like a very tight squeeze. An eerie light can be seen at the other end.

  Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you. You'd best take inventory and drop something.
