  (Testing.)
  
  >[1] offer $0.50 for mug
  "How about $2.75?" suggests the crotchety man.
  
  >[2] offer $0.50 to man
  You'll need to specify what you want to buy -- try OFFER $1000.00 FOR BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
  
  >[3] offer $6.00 for mug
  From the avaricious gleam in the eye of the crotchety man, you guess you could've gotten this purchase for less...
  
  You spend $6, and now you possess the cracked shaving mug.
  
  >[4] offer $50.00 for brooch
  You don't have that kind of cash.
  
  >[5] offer $1.50 for brooch
  The crotchety man cackles disdainfully. "If yer just here to insult me you can take your business elsewhere!" he says.
  
  >[6] offer $4.50 for brooch
  "How about $4.75?" suggests the crotchety man.
  
  >[7] no
  You reject the offer firmly.
  
  >[8] offer $4.50 for brooch
  "How about $4.63?" suggests the crotchety man.
  
  >[9] yes
  You spend $4.63, and now you possess the Victorian rhinestone brooch.
