  Weighbridge
  A blackboard propped against one wall reads: "122/10 is 12 remainder 2; 122kg/10kg is 12 remainder 2kg; 122kg/10 is 12kg remainder 2kg."
  
  The balance platform is 10m by 8m, giving it an area of 80 sq m, currently weighing nothing. The scale alongside reads: 0kg. It seems to be able to weigh several things at once.
  
  You can also see a feather and a lead pig here.
