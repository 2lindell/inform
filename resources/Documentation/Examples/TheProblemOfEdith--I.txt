> >   Discussing: penmanship
  (Testing.)
  
  >[1] think
  You contemplate infidelity.
  
  >[2] ask lady about infidelity
  "Hmm, infidelity," says Lady Uckfield. "Frankly, I rather think there would have been cause enough for divorce without the perversely plentiful evidence of unfaithfulness."
  
  >[3] show nasty letter to lady
  Lady Uckfield nods impatiently.
  
  >[4] show note to lady
  "Hmm, money," says Lady Uckfield. "I'm sorry, but I don't see how having married for money excuses a subsequent infidelity."
  
  >[5] think
  You contemplate a ten-pound note, marriage and Class status.
  
  >[6] ask lady about divorce
  "Hmm, divorce," says Lady Uckfield.
  
  >[7] ask lady about love
  "Hmm, love," says Lady Uckfield. "As it seems to me, all the love is on one side," she says crisply. "And that rarely works."
  
  >[8] ask lady about marriage
  "Hmm, marriage," says Lady Uckfield.
  
  >[9] ask lady about divorce
  "Hmm, divorce," says Lady Uckfield.
  
  >[10] ask lady about love
  "Hmm, love," says Lady Uckfield. "Stop making that plea: it won't work."
  
  >[11] ask lady about penmanship
  She sighs. "So few people write really beautifully these days."
