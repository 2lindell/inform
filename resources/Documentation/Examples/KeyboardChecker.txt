Description: Receive single key presses.

^^{Key presses}

The "code of the next pressed key" phrase returns a unicode character of the player's next keypress. Function keys are mapped to appropriate unicode values, so that the differences between the Z-Machine and Glulx can be ignored by the player. Note that the F1-F12 keys return a unicode value that may not be printable in all interpreters, and could cause an error. In an actual game you would need to check what the value is.
