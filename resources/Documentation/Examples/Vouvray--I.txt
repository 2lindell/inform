  Wine Emporium
  Set aside, you rather suspect, for tourists: this chamber is barrel-vaulted stone, lined on each side with casks of aging wine. Discarded brochures here and there advertise Wine Tours of the Loire Valley in three different languages, none of them French.
  
  You can see a Vouvray cask and a Muscadet cask here.

  That's fixed in place.
  
  >[4] x casks
  You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
  
  >[5] x muscadet cask
  You see nothing special about the Muscadet cask.
