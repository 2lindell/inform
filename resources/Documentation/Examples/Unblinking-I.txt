  Tomb of Angels
  This ancient underground tomb is lightless but for a few shafts from the surface. Everywhere in the shadows are carved angels, their faces worn away by water and pollution, their wings little more than nubs.
  
  It looks like there is no fully lit path from here to the Crash Site.
