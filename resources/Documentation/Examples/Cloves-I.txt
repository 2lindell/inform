  Poseur Club
  Lady Mary is laid out on a sofa, her wrists bandaged importantly -- and she looks all the more depressed by your indifference to her state; Salvatore is at the gaming table, clutching his hair with both hands; Frackenbush is muttering lines from another of his works in progress, as though poetry has nearly made him mad.
  
  The usual people, in short.

  But how, my dear boy, how? You simply can't do something without a pose. Thus far you have mastered doing things insouciantly, sheepishly and defiantly.
