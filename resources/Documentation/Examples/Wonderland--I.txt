  Paradise
  A handsome parking lot, a picnic ground, and the Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitor Center. The latter offers, for serious climbers, a hot shower; for nature enthusiasts, an interpretive museum; and for car-trippers, a gift shop selling canned slugs. All of which is a largely unsuccessful distraction from the peak of Mt. Rainier beyond.
