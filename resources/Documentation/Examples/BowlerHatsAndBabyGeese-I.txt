  Broad Lawn
  A sort of fun fair has been set up on this broad lawn, with the House as a backdrop: it's an attempt to give local children something to do during the bank holiday. In typical fashion, everyone is doing a very good job of ignoring the House itself, despite its swarthy roofline and dozens of blacked-out windows.

  Gazebo
  The gazebo is sometimes used for bands, but at the moment has been appropriated for the distribution of lemonade.
  
  A clown wearing a purple polka-dot bowler hat stands nearby.
  
  While the clown juggles, the baby geese visibly grow older and larger. The clown becomes unnerved.
  
  >[6] x geese
  Three or four. Or five. It's hard to count.
  
  In an attempt to resolve the problem, the clown reverses the direction of his juggling. The geese revert to goslings.
  
  >[7] s
  Better to stay here for the moment and find out what is going to happen next.
  
  The goslings become smaller and smaller until the clown is juggling goose eggs.
  
  >[8] x geese
  You can't see any such thing.
  
  >[9] x eggs
  A blur, really.
  
  The clown throws all the eggs into the air at once and catches them in the bowler hat. He takes a bow; the audience applauds. As a final gesture, he upends his hat to release a perfectly cooked omelet.
