  >[1] x beauty
  She is even more magnificent than the rumors suggested.
  
  >[2] wake beauty
  Yes, but how?
  
  >[3] pour water on beauty
  You pour out the jug of water on Sleeping Beauty.
  
  Sleeping Beauty wakes, shuddering. "Agh! I had a terrible dream about drowning and then-- Hey!"
  
  Throughout the palace you can hear the other sounds of stirring and movement as the spell of centuries is broken.
  
  "Ghastly nightmares," she remarks. You nod politely.
  
  >[4] ask beauty about sleep
  There is no reply.
  
  "I, er," she says. "I hope I'm not supposed to marry you or something."
  
  >[5] z
  Time passes.
  
  "Do you think I could go look for someone? I'm seeing him, you see, and I think I've been... sick... for a while, so he might be worried."
  
  You try to think how to point out that it's been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend.
  
  >[6] ask beauty about marriage
  "You've been up here for a hundred years," you say. An unpleasant thought occurs to you. "Was your young man in the castle somewhere?"
  
  She shakes her head mutely.
  
  
  
      *** This is going to take some explaining. ***
  
  
  
  Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?
