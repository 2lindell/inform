  The walls are painted an unattractive green; the fixtures are a bit old. But it is the only place in the hostel with any privacy.

  >[1] i
  You are carrying:
    a lockpick
    a smoke bomb
    a grappling hook
    a pair of gloves
  
  >[2] x lockpick
  Effective on most kinds of key locks, it is a gift from your mentor in the discipline, old Wheezy.
  
  >[3] out
  You need to go over your equipment first, and make sure you're ready here.
  
  >[4] x bomb
  Your last of these, so you should rely on it only when other modes of escape have vanished. It takes effect when dropped, producing a cloud of purple haze sufficient to fill a medium-sized room.
  
  Someone pounds on the door of your hideout and yells at you in Czech.
  
  >[5] out
  You're not done checking over your materials.
  
  >[6] x hook
  Good for shooting at balconies and other sorts of overhang.
  
  Impatient footsteps pass your door again.
  
  >[7] x gloves
  Black and shiny, with gripping material on the palms. Batman would be jealous.
  
  There -- nothing damaged or torn. You're ready to go.
