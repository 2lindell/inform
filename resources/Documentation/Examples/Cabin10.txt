* Possessions and clothing
(Disenchantment Bay: 10. Clothing and possessions--Basic clothing)
Disenchantment Bay: things for the player and the characters to wear and carry.

At this point we can dress both the Captain and the player with some appropriate props:

	{*}The captain wears a baseball cap. The description of the cap is "It says, THE WORST DAY FISHING IS BETTER THAN THE BEST DAY WORKING."
	
	The player is carrying a backpack and a bottle of water. The player is wearing a pair of sunglasses. The description of the sunglasses is "The light off the water and the ice does get pretty bright sometimes."

(At present the backpack can't be worn, but see the next version.)
