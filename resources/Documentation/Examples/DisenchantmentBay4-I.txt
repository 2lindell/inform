  Cabin
  The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions, which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath. A glass case against the wall contains several fishing rods.
  
  Scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and there is a door south to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.

  (Testing.)
  
  >[1] examine sign
  You can get half-day and full-day sight-seeing tours, and half-day and full-day fishing trips.
  
  >[2] examine glacier
  The Malaspina glacier covers much of the nearby slope, and -- beyond it -- an area as large as Rhode Island.
  
  >[3] examine instruments
  Knowing what they do is the Captain's job.
  
  >[4] examine windows
  They're a bit the worse for wear, but you can still get an impressive view of the glacier through them. There were whales earlier, but they're gone now.
  
  >[5] examine radar
  Apparently necessary to avoid the larger icebergs.
  
  >[6] examine radios
  With any luck you will not need to radio for help, but it is reassuring that these things are here.
  
  >[7] take the cushions
  They're hardly portable.
  
  >[8] take the glacier
  That's hardly portable.
