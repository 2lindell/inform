# This is "inrtps.giscript", a script used to generate the ".gitignore" file
# in inform/inrtps. Do not edit ".gitignore" directly. Instead, edit this
# script, and then rebuild ".gitignore" with the command:

# ../inweb/Tangled/inweb -prototype inrtps/inrtps.giscript -gitignore inrtps/.gitignore

# (Or type "make gitignores", which will remake all of the .gitignore files in
# this repository from their scripts, including this one.)
