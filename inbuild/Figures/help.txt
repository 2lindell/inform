-use-locate          show file paths of all the extensions, kits and so on needed to use
-use-missing         show the extensions, kits and so on which are needed to use but missing
-use-needs           show all the extensions, kits and so on needed to use

for translating Inform source text to Inter:
  -basic             use Basic Inform language (same as -kit BasicInformKit)
  -case X            make any source links refer to the source in extension example X
  -census            perform an extensions census (default is -no-census)
  -debug             compile with debugging features even on a Release (default is -no-debug)
  -format=X          compile to the format X (default is Inform6/32)
  -o X               use file X as the compiled output (not for use with -project)
  -project X         work within the Inform project X
  -release           compile a version suitable for a Release build (default is -no-release)
  -rng               fix the random number generator of the story file (for testing) (default is -no-rng)
  -source X          use file X as the Inform source text

for locating resources in the file system:
  -external X        use X as the user's home for installed material such as extensions
  -internal X        use X as the location of built-in material such as the Standard Rules
  -nest X            add the nest at pathname X to the search list
  -transient X       use X for transient data such as the extensions census

for tweaking code generation from Inter:
  -kit X             include Inter code from the kit called X
  -pipeline X        specify code-generation pipeline by name (default is "compile")
  -pipeline-file X   specify code-generation pipeline as file X
  -variable X        set pipeline variable X (in form name=value)

-at X                specify that this tool is installed at X
-crash               intentionally crash on internal errors, for backtracing (default is -no-crash)
-fixtime             pretend the time is 11 a.m. on 28 March 2016 for testing (default is -no-fixtime)
-help                print this help information
-locale X            set locales as 'L=E', L being shell or console, E platform, utf-8 or iso-latin1
