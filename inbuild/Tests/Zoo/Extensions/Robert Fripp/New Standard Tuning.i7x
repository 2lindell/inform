Version 3 of New Standard Tuning (for Glulx only) by Robert Fripp begins here.

"The guitar's strings are assigned the notes C2-G2-D3-A3-E4-G4 (from lowest to highest); the five lowest open strings are each tuned to an interval of a perfect fifth {(C,G),(G,D),(D,A),(A,E)}; the two highest strings are a minor third apart (E,G)."

New Standard Tuning ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

NST places the guitar strings under greater tension than standard tuning.
Standard sets of guitar strings do not work well with the tuning as the lowest
strings are too loose and the highest string may snap under the increased
tension. Special sets of NST strings have been available for decades, and some
guitarists have assembled NST sets from individual strings.
