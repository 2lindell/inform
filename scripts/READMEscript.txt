# Inform 7 @version(inform7)

## About Inform 7

Inform 7 (April 2006-) is a programming language for creating interactive
fiction, using natural language syntax. Using natural language and drawing on
ideas from linguistics and from literate programming, Inform is widely
used as a medium for literary writing, as a prototyping tool in the games
industry, and in education, both at school and university level (where
Inform is often assigned material for courses on digital narrative).
It has several times ranked in the top 100 most influential programming
languages according to the TIOBE index.

## Licence

Except as noted, copyright in material in this repository (the "Package") is
held by Graham Nelson (the "Author"), who retains copyright so that there is
a single point of reference. As from the first date of this repository
becoming public, the Package is placed under the [Artistic License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0).
This is a highly permissive licence, used by Perl among other notable projects,
recognised by the Open Source Initiative as open and by the Free Software
Foundation as free in both senses.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Author makes the further grant that users of
the Package may make unlimited use of story files produced by the Package:
such story files are not derivative works of Inform and do not inherit the
Artistic License 2.0 as an obligation. (This further grant follows the
practice of projects like bison, which also copy substantial code into
their outputs.)

## Repositories

This is the "core repository", holding source code for the compiler, and
for everything needed to run it on the command line. However:

* To build and test the compiler you also need Inweb and Intest, programs
spun out from the Inform project. These are __not included in the core
repository either as submodules or copies__, and have their own repositories.
	* [https://github.com/ganelson/inweb](https://github.com/ganelson/inweb), maintained by [Graham Nelson](https://github.com/ganelson)
	* [https://github.com/ganelson/intest](https://github.com/ganelson/intest), maintained by [Graham Nelson](https://github.com/ganelson)
* Most Inform authors use Inform as an app: for example, it is available
on the Mac App Store. While much of the UI design is the same across all
platforms, each app has its own code in its own repository. See:
	* [https://github.com/TobyLobster/Inform](https://github.com/TobyLobster/Inform) for MacOS, maintained by [Toby Nelson](https://github.com/TobyLobster)
	* [https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Inform7](https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Inform7) for Windows, maintained by [David Kinder](https://github.com/DavidKinder)
	* [https://github.com/ptomato/gnome-inform7](https://github.com/ptomato/gnome-inform7) for Linux, maintained by [Philip Chimento](https://github.com/ptomato)

## Build Instructions

Make a directory in which to work: let's call this "work". Then:

* Clone and build Inweb into "work/inweb": repository [here](https://github.com/ganelson/inweb).
* Clone and build Intest into "work/intest": repository [here](https://github.com/ganelson/intest).
* Clone Inform into "work/inform". Change the current directory to that.
Then run "bash scripts/first.sh" (or whatever shell you prefer: it need
not be bash). This should give you a complete working set of command-line
Inform tools and associated makefiles. For any future builds, you can simply
type "make".
* For a simple test, try e.g. "inblorb/Tangled/inblorb -help". All the
executables should similarly respond to -help.
* But for a true test, run "make check". This compiles two more tools needed
only for testing (dumb-frotz and dumb-glulx), then runs Intest on each tool
in turn. Some haven't got a test suite, some have; it will run whatever it
finds. Be advised that on a 2013 laptop this all takes quarter of an hour and
sounds like a helicopter taking off.

## Inventory

**"I can't help feeling that if someone had asked me before the universe began
how it would turn out, I should have guessed something a bit less like an old
curiosity shop and a bit more like a formal French garden â€” an orderly
arrangement of straight avenues, circular walks, and geometrically shaped
trees and hedges."** (Michael Frayn)

Inform is not a single program, but an assemblage of programs and resources.
Some, including the inform7 compiler itself, are "literate programs", also
called "webs". The notation &#9733; marks these, and links are provided to
their human-readable forms. (This will be enabled when the repository
becomes public: GitHub Pages does not work on private repositories.)

@end
@itemplate('inform7/Internal/Templates/Classic', 'An older, plainer website')
@itemplate('inform7/Internal/Templates/Standard', 'The default, more modern look')

The "resources" directory holds a number of non-executable items of use to the
Inform UI applications, and to Inform websites:

@book('Changes to Inform', 'resources/Changes', 'A detailed change history of Inform 7')
@book('Writing with Inform and the Inform Recipe Book', 'resources/Documentation', 'The main Inform documentation, as seen in the apps, and in standalone Epubs')
* resources/Outcome Pages - Inrtps uses these to generate HTML outcome pages (such as those showing Problem messages in the app)
* resources/Sample Projects - Two small interactive fictions, 'Disenchantment Bay' and 'Onyx', presented as samples in the app. Inform 7

Finally, the "retrospective" directory holds ANSI C source and resources needed
to build (some) previous versions of Inform 7. At present, this is only sketchily
put together.

This GitHub project was written as a literate program, powered by a LP tool
called Inweb. While almost all programs at Github are open to inspection, most
are difficult for new readers to navigate, and are not structured for extended
reading. By contrast, a "web" (the term goes back to Knuth: see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Wikipedia</a>)
is designed to be read by humans in its "woven" form, and to be compiled or
run by computers in its "tangled" form.
These pages showcase the woven form, and are for human eyes only.</p>
