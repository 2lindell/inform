this was explained in terms of Missee Lee, a black and white cat
living in North Oxford; named for a Cambridge-educated pirate queen in
the South China seas who is the heroine &mdash; or villainess &mdash; of the
tenth in Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of children's
books, "Missee Lee" (1941). The rule was then removed, but it
seemed sad to delete the only mention of Missee, and all the more so
since she died (at a grand old age and in mid-spring) in 2008.

<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">Section 4 - Standard actions concerning the actor's vision</span>

    <span class="plain">Looking is an action applying to nothing.</span>
    <span class="plain">The looking action translates into I6 as "Look".</span>

    <span class="plain">The specification of the looking action is "The looking action describes the</span>
    <span class="plain">player's current room and any visible items, but is made more complicated</span>
    <span class="plain">by the problem of visibility. Inform calculates this by dividing the room</span>
    <span class="plain">into visibility levels. For an actor on the floor of a room, there is only</span>
    <span class="plain">one such level: the room itself. But an actor sitting on a chair inside</span>
    <span class="plain">a packing case which is itself on a gantry would have four visibility levels:</span>
    <span class="plain">chair, case, gantry, room. The looking rules use a special phrase, 'the</span>
    <span class="plain">visibility-holder of X', to go up from one level to the next: thus the</span>
    <span class="plain">visibility-holder of the case is the gantry.</span>

    <span class="plain">The 'visibility level count' is the number of levels which the player can</span>
    <span class="plain">actually see, and the 'visibility ceiling' is the uppermost visible level.</span>
    <span class="plain">For a player standing on the floor of a lighted room, this will be a count</span>
    <span class="plain">of 1 with the ceiling set to the room. But a player sitting on a chair in</span>
    <span class="plain">a closed opaque packing case would have visibility level count 2, and</span>
    <span class="plain">visibility ceiling equal to the case. Moreover, light has to be available</span>
    <span class="plain">in order to see anything at all: if the player is in darkness, the level</span>
    <span class="plain">count is 0 and the ceiling is nothing.</span>

    <span class="plain">Finally, note that several actions other than looking also produce room</span>
    <span class="plain">descriptions in some cases. The most familiar is going, but exiting a</span>
    <span class="plain">container or getting off a supporter will also generate a room description.</span>
    <span class="plain">(The phrase used by the relevant rules is 'produce a room description with</span>
    <span class="plain">going spacing conventions' and carry out or report rules for newly written</span>
    <span class="plain">actions are welcome to use this too if they would like to. The spacing</span>
    <span class="plain">conventions affect paragraph division, and note that the main description</span>
    <span class="plain">paragraph may be omitted for a place not newly visited, depending on the</span>
    <span class="plain">VERBOSE settings.) Room descriptions like this are produced by running the</span>
    <span class="plain">check, carry out and report rules for looking, but are not subject to</span>
    <span class="plain">before, instead or after rules: so they do not count as a new action. The</span>
    <span class="plain">looking variable 'room-describing action' holds the action name of the</span>
    <span class="plain">reason a room description is currently being made: if the player typed</span>
    <span class="plain">LOOK, this will indeed be set to the looking action, but if we're</span>
    <span class="plain">describing a room just reached by GO EAST, say, it will be set to the going</span>
    <span class="plain">action. This can be used to customise carry out looking rules so that</span>
    <span class="plain">different forms of description are used on going to a room as compared with</span>
    <span class="plain">looking around while already there."</span>

    <span class="plain">The looking action has an action name called the room-describing action.</span>
    <span class="plain">The looking action has a truth state called abbreviated form allowed.</span>
    <span class="plain">The looking action has a number called the visibility level count.</span>
    <span class="plain">The looking action has an object called the visibility ceiling.</span>

    <span class="plain">Setting action variables for looking (this is the determine visibility ceiling</span>
        <span class="plain">rule):</span>
        <span class="plain">if the actor is the player, calculate visibility ceiling at low level;</span>
        <span class="plain">now the visibility level count is the visibility ceiling count calculated;</span>

    <span class="plain">a container or onto a supporter? And so on.</span>

    <span class="plain">Inform instead provides the action for the user to attach specific rules to.</span>
