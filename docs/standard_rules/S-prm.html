<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP1"></a><b>&#167;1. Title. </b>Every Inform 7 extension begins with a standard titling line and a
rubric text, and the Standard Rules are no exception:

<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">Version [[Version Number]] of the Standard Rules by Graham Nelson begins here.</span>

    <span class="plain">"The Standard Rules, included in every project, define phrases, actions and</span>

</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP2"></a><b>&#167;2. Verbs. </b>This continues the built-in verbs (i.e. those with meaning built in to the
Inform compiler), adding those which are relevant only to IF.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Note the plus notation, added in May 2016, which marks for a second object
phrase, and is thus only useful for built-in meanings.
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">The verb to begin when means the built-in scene-begins-when meaning.</span>
    <span class="plain">The verb to end when means the built-in scene-ends-when meaning.</span>
    <span class="plain">The verb to end + when means the built-in scene-ends-when meaning.</span>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP3"></a><b>&#167;3.  </b>Verbs used as imperatives: "Test ... with ...", for example.

<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">The verb to test + with in the imperative means the built-in test-with meaning.</span>
    <span class="plain">The verb to understand + as in the imperative means the built-in understand-as meaning.</span>
    <span class="plain">The verb to release along with in the imperative means the built-in release-along-with meaning.</span>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP4"></a><b>&#167;4. Use Options. </b>In fact, many of the definitions below are handled slightly differently in
the <code class="display"><span class="extract">srules</span></code> template files, to avoid the need for conditional compilatipn
(and thus to enable the template to be assimilated just once); but we
continue to give them the traditional constant names, for the sake of any
third-party extensions using these.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP5"></a><b>&#167;5.  </b>This setting is to do with the command parser's handling of multiple objects.
Essentially it means that "take all" can pick up at most 100 items.
