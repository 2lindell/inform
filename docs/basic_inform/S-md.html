Whereas the Standard Rules for interactive fiction are luxuriant in providing these, the Basic Inform kernel is as small as it sensibly can be, with just a few of each.</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP1"></a><b>&#167;1.  </b></p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">Part Two - Miscellaneous Definitions</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP2"></a><b>&#167;2. Properties. </b>The following declaration is misleading, since Inform doesn't read it
literally. "Variable initial value" is in fact the only property common
to global variables, a behind-the-scenes convenience. It's not visible
or useful in regular coding, and doesn't belong to objects.
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">An object has a value called variable initial value.</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP3"></a><b>&#167;3.  </b>Objects do, however, have a wealth of properties to do with their naming.
"Specification" is special: it isn't compiled, but holds text used to
annotate the Kinds index. "Indefinite appearance text" is also an internal
property (it holds the text sometimes given in double-quotes immediately
after an object is created).
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">An object has a text called specification.</span>
    <span class="plain">An object has a text called indefinite appearance text.</span>
    <span class="plain">An object has a text called printed name.</span>
    <span class="plain">An object has a text called printed plural name.</span>
    <span class="plain">An object has a text called an indefinite article.</span>
    <span class="plain">An object can be plural-named or singular-named. An object is usually singular-named.</span>
    <span class="plain">An object can be proper-named or improper-named. An object is usually improper-named.</span>
    <span class="plain">An object can be ambiguously plural.</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP4"></a><b>&#167;4.  </b>In the age of Inter as a target language, "translates into I6" is not to
be taken literally. These are instead identifier names which will be used to
annotate our Inter code.
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">The indefinite article property translates into I6 as "article".</span>
    <span class="plain">The printed plural name property translates into I6 as "plural".</span>
    <span class="plain">The printed name property translates into I6 as "short_name".</span>
    <span class="plain">The plural-named property translates into I6 as "pluralname".</span>
    <span class="plain">The ambiguously plural property translates into I6 as "ambigpluralname".</span>
    <span class="plain">The proper-named property translates into I6 as "proper".</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP5"></a><b>&#167;5. Variables. </b>Most of the built-in kinds and kind constructors, such as "number" and
"list of K", are defined in special low-level files read in by Inform early
in its run &mdash; not here. "Natural language" is an exception.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">"Language of play" should no longer be taken to imply play; it's really the
natural language of our output text, if any. It affects how verbs conjugate,
and what "say N in words" does, for example.
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">A natural language is a kind of value.</span>
    <span class="plain">The language of play is a natural language that varies.</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP6"></a><b>&#167;6.  </b>The "parameter-object" is, as its hyphenated name suggests, an internal
implementation convenience. When a rulebook runs on a given value, it holds
that value. It is really an alias, not a fixed variable, and has whatever
kind is appropriate to the rulebook currently running. (In particular,
despite the definition below, it is not necessarily an object.)
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">The parameter-object is an object that varies.</span>
    <span class="plain">The parameter-object variable translates into I6 as "parameter_value".</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP7"></a><b>&#167;7. Rulebooks. </b>The Standard Rules (for interactive fiction) create a wealth of rulebooks
and activities in order to model a fictional world. Here we are much more
sparing: a Basic Inform project begins with a very minimal number of rules.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The startup and shutdown rulebooks, and the "starting the virtual machine"
activity, are not normally used in Basic Inform, but need to be defined here
for technical reasons.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Be wary modifying these: rulebooks and activities must be defined in exactly
the right order, matching definitions both in the Inform 7 compiler and in the
template libraries. (Remember that creating an activity creates three rulebooks.)
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">Startup rules is a rulebook.</span>
    <span class="plain">Startup rules have outcomes allow startup (success) and deny startup (failure).</span>
    <span class="plain">Shutdown rules is a rulebook.</span>

    <span class="plain">Starting the virtual machine (documented at act_startvm) is an activity.</span>
    <span class="plain">The enable Glulx acceleration rule is listed first in for starting the virtual machine.</span>
    <span class="plain">The enable Glulx acceleration rule translates into I6 as "ENABLE_GLULX_ACCEL_R".</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP8"></a><b>&#167;8.  </b>However, the two activities for printing names of objects are indeed
functional in Basic Inform.
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">Printing the name of something (documented at act_pn) is an activity.</span>

    <span class="plain">The standard name printing rule is listed last in the for printing the name rulebook.</span>
    <span class="plain">The standard name printing rule translates into I6 as "STANDARD_NAME_PRINTING_R".</span>

    <span class="plain">Printing the plural name of something (documented at act_ppn) is an activity.</span>

    <span class="plain">The standard printing the plural name rule is listed last in the for printing the plural name rulebook.</span>
    <span class="plain">The standard printing the plural name rule translates into I6 as "STANDARD_PLURAL_NAME_PRINTING_R".</span>
