    <span class="plain">Version [[Version Number]] of Basic Inform by Graham Nelson begins here.</span>

    <span class="plain">"Basic Inform, included in every project, defines the basic framework</span>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP2"></a><b>&#167;2. Verbs. </b>The first task is to create the verbs which enable us to do everything
else. The first sentence should really read "The verb to mean means the
built-in verb-means meaning", but that would be circular. So Inform
starts with two verbs built in, "to mean" and "to be", with "to mean"
having the built-in "verb-means meaning", and "to be" initially having
no meaning at all. (We need "to be" because this enables us to conjugate
forms of "mean" such as "X is meant by": note the "is".)
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">So we actually start by defining the copular verb "to be". This has a
dozen special meanings, all valid only in assertion sentences, as well
as its regular one.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP6"></a><b>&#167;6.  </b>We might as well declare these numerical comparisons now, too, though
they're not needed for any of the world-building work. (The verbal usages <code class="display"><span class="extract">&lt;</span></code>,
<code class="display"><span class="extract">&gt;</span></code>, <code class="display"><span class="extract">&lt;=</span></code> and <code class="display"><span class="extract">&gt;=</span></code> are built into Inform; those would be the same in any
language, and are unlike other verbs since they have no inflected forms for
non-present tenses.)

how they have effect.)

</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The "dynamic memory allocation" defined here is slightly misleading, in
that the memory is only actually consumed in the event that any of the
kinds needing to use the heap is actually employed in the source
text being compiled. (8192 bytes may not sound much these days, but in the
tight array space of the Z-machine it's quite a large commitment, and we
want to avoid it whenever possible.)

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP10"></a><b>&#167;10.  </b>Some Inform 7 projects are rather heavy-duty by the expectations of the
Inform 6 compiler (which it uses as a code-generator): I6 was written fifteen
years earlier, when computers were unimaginably smaller and slower. So many
of its default memory settings need to be raised to higher maxima.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Note that the Z-machine cannot accommodate more than 255 verbs, so this is
the highest <code class="display"><span class="extract">MAX_VERBS</span></code> setting we can safely make here.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The <code class="display"><span class="extract">MAX_LOCAL_VARIABLES</span></code> setting is suppressed by I7 if we're compiling
to the Z-machine, because it's only legal in I6 when compiling to Glulx.
