    <span class="plain">Definition: a number is positive if it is greater than zero.</span>
    <span class="plain">Definition: a number is negative if it is less than zero.</span>

    <span class="plain">Definition: a text is empty rather than non-empty if I6 routine</span>

    <span class="plain">Definition: a table name is empty rather than non-empty if the number of filled rows in it is 0.</span>
    <span class="plain">Definition: a table name is full rather than non-full if the number of blank rows in it is 0.</span>

    <span class="plain">Definition: a rulebook is empty rather than non-empty if I6 routine "RulebookEmpty" says so (it</span>
        <span class="plain">contains no rules, so that following it does nothing and makes no decision).</span>

    <span class="plain">Definition: an activity is empty rather than non-empty if I6 routine "ActivityEmpty" says so (its</span>
        <span class="plain">before, for and after rulebooks are all empty).</span>

    <span class="plain">Definition: a verb is modal rather than non-modal if I6 routine "VerbIsModal"</span>
        <span class="plain">says so (it modifies the likelihood of another verb happening, rather than</span>
        <span class="plain">being meaningful itself).</span>

    <span class="plain">Definition: a verb is meaningful rather than meaningless if I6 routine "VerbIsMeaningful"</span>

then quotes some documentation for Inform to weave into index pages: though
here it's more of a polite refusal than a manual, since the entire system
documentation is really the description of what was defined in this
extension.
