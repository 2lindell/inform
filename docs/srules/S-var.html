space and time.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Although users often think of the protagonist object as a fixed object
whose name is "player", this is a variable, and it is possible to change
perspective during play and become somebody else &mdash; at which point the
"player" variable will point to a different object.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Note that "player" is a name given to a variable explicitly defined in
the <code class="display"><span class="extract">srules</span></code> template with a given name (in this case <code class="display"><span class="extract">player</span></code>), so it
has a "translates into I6" sentence.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP2"></a><b>&#167;2.  </b>The I7 variable "location" corresponds to I6's <code class="display"><span class="extract">real_location</span></code>, not
<code class="display"><span class="extract">location</span></code>. Its value is never equal to a pseudo-room representing darkness:
it is always an actual room, and I7 has nothing corresponding to I6's
<code class="display"><span class="extract">thedark</span></code> "room". Similarly, we use an I7 variable "darkness witnessed" for a
flag which the I6 library would have stored as the <code class="display"><span class="extract">visited</span></code> attribute for the
<code class="display"><span class="extract">thedark</span></code> object.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP3"></a><b>&#167;3.  </b>It is arguable that "noun", "second noun" and "person asked" ought
to be rulebook variables belonging to the action-processing rules, so that
they essentially did not exist outside of the context of an ongoing action.
The reason this isn't done is partly historical (rulebook variables were a
fairly late development, implemented in April 2007, though they had long
been planned). But it is sometimes useful to get at the nouns in an action
after it has finished, and making them global variables also makes them a
little faster to look up (a good thing since they are used so much), and
causes them to be indexed more prominently.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">"Item described" is simply an I7 name for <code class="display"><span class="extract">self</span></code>. (This is an Inter variable
which refers to the object currently under discussion.) In early drafts of I7,
it was called "this object", but somehow this raised expectations too high
about how often it would be meaningful: it looked like a pronoun running
meanings from sentence to sentence.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP4"></a><b>&#167;4.  </b>"Person reaching" turns out to have exactly the same meaning as "person
asked" &mdash; they are both the <code class="display"><span class="extract">actor</span></code>, in Inter terms, but are used in different
situations.

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP5"></a><b>&#167;5.  </b>Parsing variables follow. The I6 parser tends to put any data read as part
of a command into the variable <code class="display"><span class="extract">parsed_number</span></code>, but then, Inter is typeless:
we can't have a single I7 variable for all these possibilities since it could
then have no legal type. We solve this as follows. Whenever a kind of value
K is created which can be parsed as part of a command, an I7 variable "the
K understood" is also created, as a K that varies. All of these variables
are translated into Inter's <code class="display"><span class="extract">parsed_number</span></code>, so in effect they provide aliases
of each possible type for the same underlying memory location. The four
exceptional kinds of value not parsed by the systematic approaches in Inform
for enumerated KOVs and units are "number", "time", "snippet" and "truth
state": because of their exceptional status, they don't get "the K
understood" variables created automatically for them, so we must construct
those by hand. Hence "the number understood", "the time understood", "the
topic understood" (for historical reasons this one is not called "the snippet
understood"), "the truth state understood" but no others.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP8"></a><b>&#167;8.  </b>...but they are not the last global variables created by the Standard Rules.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">These bibliographic data variables are concealed because they are under a
heading which ends with the word "unindexed". There are two reasons why
these variables are unindexed: first, they appear in a different guise only
a little lower in the Contents index as part of the Library Card, and
second, we don't want users to think of them as manipulable during play.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Rather sneakily, we also define a Figure here. This is done in order to
make it legal to declare variables and properties of the kind of value
"figure name" (because it ensures that such variables can always be
initialised &mdash; there is always at least one Figure in the world). Of
course plenty of Inform projects have no artwork at all: so the cover art
figure is unique in that it might refer to nothing. That sounds a little
arbitrary but in fact follows a convention used by the Blorb format for
binding story files with their resources, which in turn follows Infocom
conventions of 1987-89: the cover art always has resource ID number 1,
whether it exists or not. Inform creates figures and sound effects counting
upwards from 1, giving them each unique resource ID numbers, so the first
to be created gets ID number 1: by defining "figure of cover" here, we
can be sure that we are first, so everything works.

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP9"></a><b>&#167;9.  </b>And we finish out the set with some "secret" variables used only by the
Standard Rules or by Inform, and which are therefore also unindexed. Their
names are all hyphenated, to reduce the chance of anyone stumbling into
them in a namespace clash.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The first set of three secret variables is used by the predicate calculus
machinery in Inform. This is the code which handles logical sentences such as
"at least six doors are open" or descriptions such as "open doors", by
reducing them to a logical notation which sometimes makes use of variables.
For instance, "open doors" reduces to something like "all x such that
door(x) and open(x)", with x being a variable. When Inform works with
such logical propositions, it often needs to substitute x=c, that is, to
replace x with a given constant c. But it can only do this if c is an
Inform 7 value. This is a problem if what it wants is to substitute in
something which is only meaningful at the I6 level: say, it wants to
substitute a value c which will eventually translate to <code class="display"><span class="extract">whatever</span></code>, but
it can't find any I7 value c which will do this.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">We solve this problem by constructing some unusual I7 variables whose only
purpose is that Inform can use them in substitutions. They should never be
referred to in I7 source text anywhere else at all, not even elsewhere in
the Standard Rules.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<ul class="items"><li>(1) The sentence "The i6-nothing-constant is an object that varies." is
a rare example of a flat lie in the Standard Rules, as it is the I6 constant
<code class="display"><span class="extract">nothing</span></code> and never varies at all. It exists as a "variable" so that the
substitution x=~<code class="display"><span class="extract">nothing</span></code> can be made.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(2) Well, once you start telling lies it's so hard to stop, and it's also a
lie that the "I6-varying-global" translates to <code class="display"><span class="extract">nothing</span></code>. It actually
translates to whatever the Inform machinery for compiling propositions happens
to want at the moment, so it has no permanent meaning at all. (It will
always translate to an I6 global variable storing a value whose I7 kind
is "object", so the type-checking machinery isn't endangered by this
chicanery. It will in fact never translate to <code class="display"><span class="extract">nothing</span></code>, but we make the
translation sentence below in order to avoid allocating any storage at
run-time for what is in the end only a label.)
</li></ul>

<pre class="display">

an object being pushed by a command like PUSH ARMCHAIR NORTH out of I6
and into the action variable "thing gone with" of the going action.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(2) The "actor-location" is needed temporarily to store the room in
which the actor of the current action is standing, and it wants to be
an I6 global (rather than, say, a rulebook variable belonging to the
action-processing rulebook) so that Inform can use common code to handle
this alongside <code class="display"><span class="extract">noun</span></code>, <code class="display"><span class="extract">second</span></code> and <code class="display"><span class="extract">actor</span></code> when compiling preambles

<p class="inwebparagraph">Note, however, that many of these have explicit support in the <code class="display"><span class="extract">basicinform</span></code>

</li><li>(3) Follow the shutdown rules.

<p class="inwebparagraph">Briefly, the startup phase takes us to the end of the room description
after the banner is printed. The turn sequence covers a complete turn,
and runs through from prompting the player for a command to notifying
him of any change in score which occurred. The shutdown rules then go
from printing the obituary text, through final score, to the question
about quitting or restarting.

with before, instead and after rules, such as that custodians at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art forbid flash photography.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<ul class="items"><li>(b) To improve the efficiency of action-processing by forcing control to
run only through those carry out, check and report rules which can possibly
be relevant to the current action. Whereas all before, instead and after
rules are all piled up together in their own rulebooks, check, carry out
and report rules are divided up into specialised rulebooks tied to the
particular action in progress. Thus on a taking action, the six stages
followed are before, instead, check taking, carry out taking, after and
report taking.
</li></ul>
<p class="inwebparagraph">During play, then, the three rulebooks "check", "after" and "report"
are completely empty. This is the result of a reform in April 2007 which
wasn't altogether popular. Before then, Inform rather cleverly filed rules like
"Check doing something with the haddock" in the generic "check"
rulebook and ran this rulebook as part of the action processing sequence.
But this clearly broke principle (i) above, and meant that the six-stage
process &mdash; already quite complicated enough &mdash; was actually a nine-stage
process only pretending, by deceitful syntax, to be a six-stage one. Check
rules sometimes appeared to be filed in the wrong order, breaking the
ordinary precedence conventions, and this was not due to a bug but because
they were only pretending all to be in the same rulebook. Still more clever
indexing and rule-ordering tricks ameliorated this a little, but in the end
it was just a bad design: withdrawing the ability to make check, carry out
and report rules apply to multiple actions resulted in much cleaner code,
and also a clearer conceptual definition of what these rulebooks were for.
(But users still didn't like the change: actual functionality was
withdrawn.)
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">So if they are always empty and never used, why are the three rulebooks
called simply "check", "after" and "report" created in the first
place? The answer is that this is a convenience for parsing rule preambles
in Inform: it provides a temporary home for such rules before they are divided up
into their specific rulebooks, and it also makes it easier for Inform to detect
and give a helpful Problem message in response to rules like "Check taking
or dropping the perch" which can't be filed anywhere in our scheme, and so
have to be forbidden.

scale of responses, rather than wanting something to be done, and (ii) it
doesn't really make any sense to split that question into a before, for and
after stage. So this is a named rulebook instead.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">"Does the player mean" is essentially a front end for the I6 parser's

"report dropping" rulebooks &mdash; but there are no more stand-alone rulebooks.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP21"></a><b>&#167;21. Rules. </b>At run-time, the value of a rule is the (packed) address of an I6 routine.
In the case of rules created in I7 source text, the body of the rule
definition is compiled by Inform to a new I6 routine which carries it out.
But there are also primitive rules which are implemented in the template
I6 layer, and these need no I7 source text definitions: instead we simply
tell Inform the name of the I6 routine which will be handling this rule, and
that it need not bother to create one for itself.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">An example of this is provided by the first rule we shall create: the
"little-used do nothing rule". This is aptly named on both counts. We
never follow it, we never put it into any rulebook. It exists only so that
variables and properties with the kind of value "rule" can be initialised
automatically to a safely neutral default value. It makes no decision.

to either end as "first" or "last", but entirely legal, and we make
use of that ability here.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The "first" rules here are the ones which get the basic machinery working
to the point where it is safe to run arbitrary I7 source text. They necessarily
do very low-level things, and it is not guaranteed that I7 phrases will behave
to specification if executed before these early rules have finished. So it
is hazardous to obstruct or alter them.

begin execution on the virtual machine in use: this entails relatively little
on the Z-machine versions 5 or 8, but can involve extensive work to get the

the "starting the virtual machine" activity (see below) is carried out.

way to make deterministic tests of programs which use random values).
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(d) The "update chronological records rule" is described in further detail
below, since it appears both here and also in the turn sequence rulebook.
Here it's providing us with a baseline of initial truths from which we can
later assess conditions such as "the marble door has been open". A subtle
and questionable point of the design is that this rule is placed at a time
when the object representing the player is not present in the model world.
This is done to avoid regarding the initial situation as one of the turns
for purposes of a rule preamble like "... when the player has been in the
Dining Room for three turns". It's as if the player teleports into an
already-existing world, like some Star Trek crewman, just in time for the
first command.

action(s) that requested is or are processed. (And may in turn cause
other actions, which must also be processed.) There is then a fair
amount of business needed to end one turn and get ready for another.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The turn sequences rulebook terminates early if <code class="display"><span class="extract">deadflag</span></code> becomes set at
any point, so the last turn of play will be incomplete. Besides that
consideration, it can also end early if the command for the turn was
for an out-of-world action such as saving the game: in such cases, the
"generate action rule" stops the rulebook once the action has been
fully processed. All the same, play basically consists of running down
this list of rules over and over again.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP25"></a><b>&#167;25.  </b>The "first" rules in the turn sequence cover us up to the end of the

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<ul class="items"><li>(a) The "parse command rule" prints up the prompt, reads a command from
the keyboard, parses it into dictionary words, deals with niceties such as
UNDO or OOPS, and then runs it through the traditional I6 parser to turn
it into a request for an action or list of actions. But see note below.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(b) The "mentioned" property records whether something's name has been
printed since the last command.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(c) The "generate action rule" then either sends a single action to the
action-processing rules, or else runs through the list, printing the noun
up with a colon each time and then sending the action to the action-processing
rules. But see note below.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(d) We then run the scene changing rulebook, because people often write
every turn rules which are predicated on particular scenes ("Every turn
during the Grand Waltz: ..."), and such rules will fail if we haven't kept
up with possible scene changes arising from something done in the action(s)
just completed.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(e) The "every turn stage rule" follows the every turn rulebook. This
earns its place among the "first" rules in order for it to have priority
over all the other book-keeping rules at the end of a turn &mdash; including any
which the user, or an extension included by the user, chooses to add to the
turn sequence rules.
</li></ul>
<p class="inwebparagraph">An unusual point here is that the "parse command rule" and the
"generate action rule" are written such that they do nothing unless
the turn sequence rulebook is being followed at the top level (by <code class="display"><span class="extract">Main</span></code>,
that is). This prevents them from being used recursively, which would not
work properly, and enables a popular trick from the time before the 2008
reform to keep working: we can simulate six turns going by in which the
player does nothing by running "follow the turn sequence rules" six
times in a row. Everything happens exactly as it should &mdash; the turn count,
the time of day, timed events, and so on &mdash; except that no commands are

</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(g) The "update chronological records rule" tells the chronology machine
that a slice of time has been completed. Inform can only decide past tense
conditions like "the black door has been open" by continuously measuring
the present to see if the black door is open now, and making a note for
future reference if it is. But of course it's impossible for any computer
to continuously do anything, and besides, Inform has other calls on it.
What in fact happens is the Inform performs these measurements at "chronology
points", which are strategic moments during play, and this is one of them.

ago, but scene changes might well have arisen as a result of rules which

way, and it's important to start the next turn in the correct scene &mdash; so we
check again to make sure.

<ul class="items"><li>(i) Then we run the "adjust light rule". Keeping track of light and darkness
is quite difficult, and potentially also quite slow: it's not unlike a sort
of discretised version of ray-tracing, with many light sources and barriers
to think about (some transparent, some opaque). So we do this as little as
possible: once per turn we calculate whether the player is in light or not,
and act accordingly if so.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(j) The "note object acquisitions rule" does two things:
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><ul class="items"><li>(i) Gives the "handled" property to everything carried or worn by the player.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP32"></a><b>&#167;32. Action-processing. </b>Action-processing happens on two levels: an upper level, handled by the main
"action-processing" rulebook, and a lower level, "specific action-processing".
This division clearly complicates matters, so why do we do it? It turns out be
convenient for several reasons:
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<ul class="items"><li>(a) Out-of-world actions like "saving the game" need to run through the
lower level, or they won't do anything at all, but must not run through the
upper level, or in-world rules (before or instead rules, for instance) might
prevent them from happening.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(b) Requested actions such as generated by a command like "CLARK, BLOW WHISTLE"
have the reverse behaviour, being handled at the upper level but not the lower.
(If Clark should agree, a definite non-request action "Clark blowing the whistle"
is generated afresh: that one does indeed get to the lower level, but the original
request action doesn't.)
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(c) Specific action-processing has a rather complicated range of outcomes:
it must succeed or fail, according to whether the action either reaches the
carry out rules or is converted into another action which does, but also
ensure that in the event of failure, the exact rule causing the failure is
recorded in the "reason the action failed" variable.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(d) The specific action-processing stage is where we have to split consideration
into action-specific rulebooks (like "check taking") rather than general ones
(like "instead"). To get this right, we want to use some rulebook variables,
and these need to be set at exactly the correct moment. It's tricky to
arrange for that in the middle of a big rulebook, but easy to do so at the
beginning, so we want the start of the SA-P stage to happen at the start of
a rulebook.
</li></ul>
<p class="inwebparagraph">This does mean that an attempt by the user to move the before stage to just
after the check stage (say) will fail &mdash; the before and check stages happen
in different rulebooks, so no amount of rearranging will do this.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP33"></a><b>&#167;33.  </b>The upper level of action-processing consists of seeing whether the actor's
current situation forbids the action from being tried: does anybody or
anything intervene to stop it? Are there are any basic reasons of physical
realism why nobody could possibly try it? Does it require somebody else
to cooperate who in fact chooses not to?
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Doctrinally, the before stage must see actions before anything else can
happen. (It needs the absolute freedom to start fresh actions and dispose
of the one originally intended, sure in the knowledge that no other rules
have been there first.) So before-ish material is anchored at the "first"
end of the rulebook.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The other book-end on the shelf is provided by the instead stage, which
doctrinally happens only when the action is now thought to be physically
reasonable. So this is anchored at the "last" end. (In fact it is followed
by several more rules also anchored there, but this is essentially just
the clockwork machinery showing through: they aren't realism checks.)
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Miscellaneous general rules to do with physical realism are placed between
the two book-ends, then, and this is where any newly created action-processing
rules created by the user or by extensions will go.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP35"></a><b>&#167;35.  </b>The final rule in the rulebook always succeeds: this ensures that
action-processing always makes a decision. (I7's doctrine is that an
action "succeeds" if and only if its carry-out stage is reached, so
any action getting right to the end of this rulebook must have
succeeded.)
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">This is the end action-processing in success rule: rule succeeds.</span>
</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP36"></a><b>&#167;36.  </b>The action-processing rulebook contains six primitives:
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<ul class="items"><li>(1) The "basic visibility rule" checks the action to see if it requires
light, and if so, and if the actor is the player and in darkness, asks
the visibility rules (see below) whether the lack of light should stop
the action. (It would be cleaner to apply this rule to all actors, but we
would need much more extensive light calculations to do this.)
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(2) The "basic accessibility rule" checks the action to see if it requires
the noun to be touchable, and if so, asks the accessibility rulebook to
adjudicate (see below); then repeats the process for the second noun.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(3) The "carrying requirements rule" checks the action to see if it requires
the noun to be carried. If so, but the noun is not carried, it generates an
implicit taking action (in effect, "try silently taking N"); and if that
fails, then the rulebook is halted in failure. The process is then repeated
for the second noun.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(4) If the action is one where the player requests somebody else to do
something, the "requested actions require persuasion rule" asks the
persuasion rulebook for permission.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(5) If the action is one where the player requests somebody else to do
something, the "carry out requested actions rule" starts a new action by
the person asked, and looks at the result: if it failed, the "unsuccessful
attempt by" rulebook is run to tell the player what has (not) happened.
(If that does nothing, a bland message is printed.) In all cases, the
original action of requesting is ended in success: a success because,
whatever happened, the request succeeded in making the actor try to do
something.
</li></ul>
<ul class="items"><li>(6) The "descend to specific action-processing rule" really only runs the
specific action-processing rulebook, but it's implemented as a primitive in
the template I6 layer because it must also find out which are the
specific check, carry out and report rulebooks for the current action (for
instance, "check taking" is the specific check rulebook for the
"taking" action &mdash; which seems obvious from the names: but at run-time,
the names aren't so visible).
</li></ul>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP38"></a><b>&#167;38.  </b>The unusual use of "anonymously abide by" above is a form of "abide
by" which may be worth explaining. Suppose rule X consists of an
instruction to abide by rulebook Y, and suppose that Y in fact fails
when it reaches Y_k. If the ordinary "abide by" is used then the action
will be deemed to have failed at rule X, but if "anonymously abide by"
is used then it will be deemed to have failed at Y_k. (Thus X remains
anonymous: it can never be the culprit.) We only use this at the check
stage, because the carry out, report and after stages are not allowed to
fail the action. (The after stage is allowed to end it, but not in
failure.)
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP39"></a><b>&#167;39.  </b>The specific action-processing rulebook is probably more fruitful than the
