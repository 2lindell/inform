creating any activity automatically creates three rulebooks as well.

<p class="inwebparagraph">Once again, there are no activities or assumptions about them built into
NI, but the template I6 layer expects the following 26 activities to be
created and in this order. (That is, the order here must exactly match that
of the <code class="display"><span class="extract">*_ACT</span></code> constant definitions made in <code class="display"><span class="extract">Definitions.i6t</span></code>.) The activities
are fairly completely described in the Inform documentation, so the only
notes here concern implementation.

</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">Most of the activities begin with all three rulebooks empty, since by
default they do not intervene. This one, however, has a "last" for-rule,
because it's required to do something definite: it must actually print a
name, and the last for-rule is the default way to do this. (The assumption
is that any other for-rule added by the user will halt the rulebook before
the default implementation is reached.) We also include a before rule which
marks any item whose name is being printed with the "mentioned" property,
for reasons to be found below.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP13"></a><b>&#167;13.  </b>The supplying activities are linguistically interesting, for reasons gone
into in the paper "Interactive Fiction, Natural Language and Semantic
Analysis": English verbs do not naturally seem to feature optional nouns.
Indeed, we say "it rained on Tuesday" where "it" refers to nothing at all,
merely because we can't bring ourselves to leave a gap and say just "rained
on Tuesday". A better example here would be "it sounded like rain", because
we do the same to convey the idea of listening ambiently rather than to
any single thing: listening appears to be rare among actions in that it can
equally well take a noun as not. Just as English handles this problem by
supplying a spurious "it" which appears to mean "the world at large",
so Inform handles it by supplying the current location, with the same idea
in mind. And the same applies to the sense of smell, which can be similarly
defocused.

either be text describing the option &mdash; e.g., "perform a RESTART" &mdash; or
can be left blank, making the option a secret one, omitted from the question
but still recognised as an answer. The only if victorious entry can be set
to make the option available only after a victorious ending, not after a loss;
Infocom's traditional AMUSING option behaved thus. Finally, the table
specifies what to do if the option is taken: either it provides a rule,
or an activity to carry out. (If it provides only an activity, but that
activity is empty, then the option is omitted from the question and not
recognised as an answer.)

<p class="inwebparagraph">A locale typically contains a run of paragraphs specific to interesting
items, especially those not yet picked up, followed by a paragraph which
lists the "nondescript" items &mdash; those not given paragraphs of their own,
such as the bucket and spade. (Some items, though &mdash; typically scenery,
but also for instance the player &mdash; are not even nondescript and do not
appear at all.) A locale can contain no interesting paragraphs, or no list
of nondescript items, or can even contain neither: that is, it can be
entirely empty.

<p class="inwebparagraph">When the player is in or on top of something, multiple locales are described:

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP24"></a><b>&#167;24. Locale Implementation. </b>When describing a locale, we keep a Table of interesting objects, each
associated with a priority &mdash; a number indicating how important, and
therefore how near to the top of the description, the object is. A special
syntax allows us to create the Table with exactly the same number of rows
as there are things in the model world: thus, in the worst case where
all things are in a single locale, we still will not run out of table
rows. (We do this rather than creating a large but fixed-size table
because memory is very short in some Z-machine I7 works, so we want to
take only what we might actually need. The table structure is not as
wasteful as it might look: an experiment with using a number property
of things instead showed that this table was actually more efficient,
because of the property numbering overhead in the Z-machine memory
representation of objects.)

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP25"></a><b>&#167;25. Printing the Locale Description. </b>This is handled by the "printing the locale description" activity. The
before stage works out which objects might be of interest; the for stage
actually prints paragraphs; the after stage is initially empty, but can be
used to insert all kinds of interesting information into a room description.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">We count the paragraphs printed in a global variable, not an activity variable,
since it needs to be consulted in sub-activities whose rules are outside what
would be its scope; that doesn't matter, though, since locale descriptions
are not nested. (If they were, the above table would fail in any case.)
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<ul class="items"><li>(1) Disaster would ensue if the user tampered with the "initialise locale
description rule", but nobody is likely to do this other than intentionally.
</li><li>(2) The "find notable locale objects rule" in fact only runs a further
activity, the "choosing notable locale objects" activity. The task here
is to identify the objects which might by virtue of their location appear
in the locale, and to assign each of them a priority number.
</li><li>(3) The "interesting locale paragraphs rule" goes through all of the
notable objects chosen at stage (2), in order of priority, and offers each
to yet another activity: the "printing a locale paragraph about" activity.
This can either print a paragraph related to the item in question, or
demote it as being not even nondescript (by changing its priority to 0).
The default is to do nothing, in which case the item becomes nondescript.
</li><li>(4) The "you-can-also-see rule" prints what is, ordinarily, the final
paragraph of the locale description, listing the nondescript items. It
goes to some trouble to find out whether these all have a common object tree
parent, listing them with "list contents of" if they do: this is so that
people who have written rules such as "Rule for printing the name of the
blur while listing contents..." will take effect, because the "listing
contents" activity will be going on. Provided that the notable objects
chosen in (2) are all children of the locale domain, this will always
happen. If the user should add rules to make quite different objects also
notable, then the "you-can-also-see rule" has to resort to listing in
a way which doesn't use the "listing contents" activity &mdash; since the
list is not in fact a list of the contents of anything.

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP27"></a><b>&#167;27. Printing a Locale Paragraph. </b>By default there are four kinds of "interesting" locale paragraph, and
the following setup is fairly complicated because it implements conventions
gradually built up between 1978 and 2008.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">To recap, this activity is run on each notable thing in turn, in priority
order. (It is only run on notable things for efficiency reasons.)
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The basic principle is that, at every stage, we should consider an item
only if it is not "mentioned" already. This will happen if it has been
named by a previous paragraph, but also if it has been explicitly marked
as such to get rid of it. In considering an item, we have three basic
options:
</p>

<ul class="items"><li>(a) Print a paragraph about the item and mark it as mentioned &mdash; this
is good for interesting items deserving a paragraph of their own.
</li><li>(b) Print a paragraph, but do not mark it as mentioned &mdash; this is only
likely to be useful if we want to print information related to the
item without mentioning the thing itself. (For instance, if the presence
of a mysterious parcel resulted in a ticking noise, we could print a
paragraph about the ticking noise without mentioning the parcel, which
would then appear later.)
</li><li>(c) Mark the item as mentioned but print nothing &mdash; this gets rid of the
item, ensuring that it will not appear in the final "you can also see"
sentence, and will not be considered by subsequent rules.
</li><li>(d) Do nothing at all &mdash; the item then becomes "nondescript" and appears
in the final "you can also see" sentence, unless somebody else mentions
it in the mean time.
</li></ul>
<p class="inwebparagraph">Briefly, then, the following is the standard method:
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<ul class="items"><li>(1) The "don't mention player's supporter in room descriptions rule"
excludes anything the player is directly or indirectly standing on or,
less frequently, in. The header of the room description has probably
already said something like "Boudoir (on the four-poster bed)", so
the player can't be unaware of this item.
</li><li>(2) The "don't mention scenery in room descriptions rule" excludes
scenery.
</li><li>(3) The "don't mention undescribed items in room descriptions rule"
excludes the player object. (It's redundant to say "You can also see
yourself here.") At present nothing else in I7 is "undescribed"
in this sense.
</li><li>(4) The "set pronouns from items in room descriptions rule" adjusts
the meaning of pronouns like IT and HER to pick up items mentioned.
Thus if a room description ends "Mme Tourmalet glares at you.", then
HER would be adjusted to mean Mme Tourmalet.
</li><li>(5) The "offer items to writing a paragraph about rule" gives the
"printing a paragraph about" activity a chance to intervene. We detect
whether it does intervene or not by looking to see if it has printed
any text.
</li><li>(6) The "use initial appearance in room descriptions rule" uses the
initial appearance property of an object which has never been handled
as a paragraph.
</li><li>(7) The "describe what's on scenery supporters in room descriptions rule"
is a somewhat controversial feature: whereas the rest of Inform's room
description conventions are generally consensus, this one is much
disliked by some users for its occasional inappropriateness. It prints
text such as "On the mantelpiece is a piece of chalk." for items which,
like the mantelpiece, are scenery mentioned (we assume) in the main
room description. (It is assumed that scenery supporters make their contents
more prominently visible than scenery containers, which we do not announce
the contents of.) The ability to modify, replace or abolish this rule was
one of the main motivations to break room description up into activities
in March 2008.
