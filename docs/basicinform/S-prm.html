<ul class="crumbs"><li><b>basicinform</b></li></ul><p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP1"></a><b>&#167;1.  </b>Basic Inform is like a boot program for a computer that is
starting up: at the beginning, the process is delicate, and the computer
needs a fairly exact sequence of things to be done; halfway through, the
essential work is done, but the system is still too primitive to be much
use, so we begin to create convenient intermediate-level code sitting on
top of the basics; so that, by the end, we have a fully flexible machine
ready to go in any number of directions. In this commentary, we try to
distinguish between what must be done (or else Inform will crash, or fail in
some other way) and what is done simply as a design decision (to make the
Inform language come out the way we want it). Quite interesting hybrid
Informs could be built by making different decisions.
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP2"></a><b>&#167;2. Title. </b>Every Inform 7 extension begins with a standard titling line and a
rubric text, and this are no exception:
</p>


<pre class="display">
    <span class="plain">Version [[Version Number]] of Basic Inform by Graham Nelson begins here.</span>

    <span class="plain">"Basic Inform, included in every project, defines the basic framework</span>

</pre>

<p class="inwebparagraph"></p>

<p class="inwebparagraph"><a id="SP3"></a><b>&#167;3. Starting up. </b>The first task is to create the verbs which enable us to do everything
else. The first sentence should really read "The verb to mean means the
built-in verb-means meaning", but that would be circular. So Inform
starts with two verbs built in, "to mean" and "to be", with "to mean"
having the built-in "verb-means meaning", and "to be" initially having
no meaning at all. (We need "to be" because this enables us to conjugate
forms of "mean" such as "X is meant by": note the "is".)
</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">So we actually start by defining the copular verb "to be". This has a
dozen special meanings, all valid only in assertion sentences, as well
as its regular one.

    <span class="plain">The verb to be means the built-in episode meaning.</span>
    <span class="plain">The verb to be means the equality relation.</span>

a synonym for it.

in May 2016, which marks for a second object phrase, and is thus only
useful for built-in meanings.

    <span class="plain">The verb to relate means the built-in new-relation meaning.</span>
    <span class="plain">The verb to relate means the universal relation.</span>

    <span class="plain">The verb to substitute for means the built-in rule-substitutes-for meaning.</span>

    <span class="plain">The verb to do + if means the built-in rule-does-nothing-if meaning.</span>

</p>

<p class="inwebparagraph">The "dynamic memory allocation" defined here is slightly misleading, in
that the memory is only actually consumed in the event that any of the
kinds needing to use the heap is actually employed in the source
text being compiled. (8192 bytes may not sound much these days, but in the
tight array space of the Z-machine it's quite a large commitment, and we
want to avoid it whenever possible.)

<p class="inwebparagraph">Note that the Z-machine cannot accommodate more than 255 verbs, so this is

<p class="inwebparagraph">The <code class="display"><span class="extract">MAX_LOCAL_VARIABLES</span></code> setting is suppressed by I7 if we're compiling
