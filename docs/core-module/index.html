				<p><span class="purpose">In which the meaning of an S-parsed sentence is converted to a statement in predicate calculus, so that verbs and prepositions become relations, while determiners express quantifiers; this produces a mathematical proposition which can be simplified according to logical rules which change its form but not its meaning.</span></p>
				<ul class="sectionlist">
					<li>
						<p><a href="11-itpc.html"><spon class="sectiontitle">Introduction to Predicate Calculus</span></a> -

						<span class="purpose">Predicate calculus is a largely symbolic exercise, and its rules of working tend to assume that all predicates are meaningful for all terms: this means, for instance, that "if blue is 14" is likely to make a well-formed sentence in predicate calculus. In this section we reject such propositions on the grounds that they violate type-checking requirements on relations -- in this example, the equality relation.</span></p>

				<p><span class="purpose">This is where the propositions generated by the A-parser and the S-parser are at last acted upon, either immediately (generating inferences) or at run-time (by causing code to be compiled which will some day test or assert the truth of the proposition).</span></p>

						<p><a href="12-dtd.html"><spon class="sectiontitle">Deciding to Defer</span></a> -
						<span class="purpose">To decide whether a proposition can be compiled immediately, in the body of the current routine, or whether it must be deferred to a routine of its own, which is called from the current routine.</span></p>
