(Door described differently depending on where it is; When?)
A door whose description says "...leads east" in one place and "...leads west" in the other.

Very simple, but quite frequently useful:

	{*}"When?"

	The temporal vortex is an open door. It is west of Yesterday and east of Today. "A whirling temporal vortex leads [if the player is in Yesterday]west[otherwise]east[end if]."
