Disenchantment Bay: making the radar and instruments switch on and off.

If we would like the player to be able to turn instrumentation on and off, we could add a line to this effect:

	{*}The radar, the instruments, and the radios are devices.
	
And since the captain is probably not navigating blind, we might also want to say

	{**}The radar and the instruments are switched on.
