** Understanding things by their properties
(Broken and unbroken flowerpots; Terracottissima)
The flowerpots once again, but this time arranged so that after the first breakage all undamaged pots are said to be "unbroken", to distinguish them from the others.

This easiest way to do this uses the "printing the name of" activity, which will come up in the following chapter:

	{*}"Terracottissima"

	A flowerpot is a kind of thing. Understand "pot" as a flowerpot.
	
	A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken. After dropping an unbroken flowerpot: say "Crack!"; now the noun is broken. Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
	
	Before printing the name of a broken flowerpot, say "broken ". Before printing the name of an unbroken flowerpot: if a flowerpot is broken, say "unbroken ".

	Before printing the plural name of a broken flowerpot, say "broken ". Before printing the plural name of an unbroken flowerpot: if a flowerpot is broken, say "unbroken ".
	
	The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.
	
	Test me with "get three flowerpots / drop all / look".
