** Report rules for actions by other people
(Reporting rules for other characters' behavior; The Man of Steel Excuses Himself)
Elaborating the report rules to be more interesting than "Clark goes west."

Report rules can be a good point at which to add local color: while Inform provides default descriptions of character behavior, these are rather generic and can stand to be customized.

For instance, if we wanted to liven up our previous Clark Kent example:
	
	{*}Report Clark Kent going a direction (called the way):
		say "[one of]With a particularly weak excuse[or]Muttering[at random] about [random excuse subject], Clark heads [way]." instead.

	To say random excuse subject:
		choose a random row in the Table of Lame Excuses; say "[reply entry]".

	Table of Lame Excuses
	reply 
	"needing a paper-clip"
	"wanting an English-Tuvalu dictionary"
	"walking a neighbor's dog"
	"hearing air-raid sirens"
	"having drunk too much coffee"
	"thinking he smells smoke"
	"wondering where Lois got to"
	"needing to speak to Jimmy"
	"noticing the Good Year blimp"
	
It's good to be careful, as the library report rules have been designed and tested to describe every contingency (going through doors, going in vehicles, etc.): so when replacing a report rule, we should try to consider all the possible variations of the action that we might want to describe. 

However, in this case, our scenario is so simple that there are no doors, vehicles, or pushable objects, so we're safe in giving Clark a very simple reporting scheme.
