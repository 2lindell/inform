* Try and try silently
(Staircase kind of door which diverts the CLIMB command; Hayseed)
A refinement of our staircase kind which can be climbed.

Presumably all staircase-type connections between rooms should respond when the player says CLIMB STAIRS (or the equivalent). So

	{*}"Hayseed"

	A staircase is a kind of door. A staircase is usually open. A staircase is seldom openable.
	
	The ladder is a staircase. It is above the Barn and below the Hayloft.

	Instead of climbing a staircase:
		try entering the noun.
		
	Test me with "climb ladder / g".
		
Attempts to climb other types of door will still be treated as useless.
