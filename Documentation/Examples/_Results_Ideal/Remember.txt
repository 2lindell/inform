  Inadequate Shelter
  A piece of corrugated tin, leaned on two sticks, and pathetically augmented with a tire (on one side) and a cardboard box (on the side towards the wind). And that's what you've got between you and the driving rain.
  
  At the moment rain is all you can remember, in fact.

  (Testing.)
  
  >[1] remember rain
  You've seen worse, but not often: it's falling so hard now that the tin rattles and the runoff, on the low side of the roof, would be a tenable source of hydroelectric power.
  
  >[2] remember power
  It's not as though you have any sort of light bulb in here to turn on, even if you could power it.
  
  >[3] remember light bulb
  Light bulbs, like so much else, are a thing of your past. Or is it your future? Tricky, the way the world loops round on itself.
  
  >[4] remember future
  Living backwards has its drawbacks. A tendency to confuse and annoy your friends, being one; the total inability to maintain a stable relationship; and a deep dissatisfaction with most of the bodily processes people enjoy, since they ultimately make you hungrier, colder, or-- no point dwelling on it, really.
  
  >[5] remember backwards
  It's not even exactly *backwards*, now is it? It's more like a series of forwardses stuck back to back. As though someone had taken each track of a CD and put them in the exactly wrong order. You miss that. The music on demand.
