  >[1] burn all with lighter
  lighter: Best not.
  stick of gelignite: Best not.
  solid magnesium footstool: Best not.
  vodka bottle: Best not.
  inexpensive firework: It ignites gloriously! You take a few hasty steps back in order to avoid burning yourself, and not a moment too soon. Red and green sparks fly out of the tube, and there's a whistling noise punctuated by several loud cracks.
  vetiver candle: It burns right down, expensively but gothically.
