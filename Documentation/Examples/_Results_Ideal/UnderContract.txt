  >[1] give dress to clark
  (first taking the slinky dress off)
  Rowr! Not that kind of movie, babe.
  
  >[2] clark, take off pants
  He gives you a look of mocking exasperation. Apparently you'll have to take a (slightly) more subtle approach.
  
  >[3] clark, eat pants
  "What're you trying to do, poison me?"
  
  >[4] clark, give me the pants
  Clark allows his mustache to quirk at the suggestion.
  
  >[5] clark, drop pants
  Clark wiggles his eyebrows at you.
  
  >[6] clark, put the pants in the briefcase
  "That kind of thing isn't in my contract, sweetie," says Clark. "If you're interested you'll have to ask off-camera."
  
  >[7] again
  "I'd feel so... bare," Clark says, with a sidelong look at you.
  
  >[8] g
  "You first," says Clark.
  
  >[9] g
  Clark's stare is intense. You may be on the verge of breaking him.
  
  >[10] g
  Clark, driven past the point of endurance, seizes you in his arms and kisses you.
