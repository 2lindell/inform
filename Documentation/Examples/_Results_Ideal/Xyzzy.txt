  Cheez Factory
  All around you are squares of pressed orange polymer, or possibly cheez. Your only hope is the magic word your uncle taught you: XYZZY.
  
> >   Paradise
  (Testing.)
  
  >[1] x squares
  You see nothing special about the squares of pressed orange polymer. Nothing special at all.
  
  >[2] x amulet
  A heavy gold ring on a chain. If heated in an ordinary house fire, it glows with the words, "Moses Supposes His Toeses Are Roses."
  
  >[3] x cheese
  You can't see any such thing.
  
  >[4] xyzzy
  You are unable to articulate the second "z" separately from the first, and the spell fails in a disdainful puff. Must be Parisian magic.
  
  >[5] wear amulet
  You put on the amulet of elocution.
  
  >[6] xyzzy
  Under the influence of the Amulet of Elocution, you pronounce this as Xhi-zee. And lo, from nowhere, a plate of cheese appears!
  
  >[7] x ooze
  Definitely genuinely cheese.
  
  >[8] smell ooze
  It smells like socks. This is going to be wonderful.
  
  >[9] eat ooze
  You are transported...
  
  Paradise
  Well, it might just be one of the posh upper rings of purgatory, if you're entirely honest with yourself.
