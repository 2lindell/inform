  Farewell Bend Cafe
  Beautiful Farewell Bend, Idaho -- or is it Oregon? An almost-abandoned truckstop, in any case, on one of those interminable American east-west highways.
  
  Tina the waitress is slowly pouring coffee from the pot with a black neck into the pot with an orange neck.
  
  There is also a large man at table five. The tattoo on his arm says George. For the moment we will assume that it is his own name and not someone else's.
