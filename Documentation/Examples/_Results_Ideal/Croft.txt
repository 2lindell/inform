  Ancient Cambodian Temple (on the wood platform)
  A vast space built for ancient and forgotten rituals. The stone floor crawls with vermin. Well above the floor, and separated by some feet, are twin platforms built into the wall: the one carved of jointed wood, the other of sheets of graven bronze.
  
  On the bronze platform is Lara.
