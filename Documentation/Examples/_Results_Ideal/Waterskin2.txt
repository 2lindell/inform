  Campsite
  It is solid night now, and the stars have come out. Unfamiliar stars. On the other side of the valley -- a valley round-bottomed but shallow, like a soup bowl -- burn other campfires, most likely bandits. Their voices do not carry, but the smoke rises and obscures the starlight over that way.
  
  Your sleepsack is laid out in a pocket of sandy soil and coarse grass.
  
  You can also see some kindling here.
