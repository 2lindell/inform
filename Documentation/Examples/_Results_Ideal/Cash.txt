  Dessert Parlor
  An underlit, over-crowded room campily furnished with a lot of gilt-frame mirrors and twinkle lights: it is essentially a brothel of food. The service is slow at best, and on Saturday nights glacial. However. The wares on display more than make up for these trivial inconveniences.
  
  You can see a vanilla ice cream, a raspberry tart, a syllabub and an espresso cake here.
