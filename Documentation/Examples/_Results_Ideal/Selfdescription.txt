  Control Center
  Here you are at the Control Center of the universe.
  
  The Universe Management Computer sits directly before you, unguarded.
  
  Because the computer is too large for you to reach all of the front panel from a standing position, there is a command chair on casters which allows you to push back and forth.

  (Testing.)
  
  >[1] x chair
  Quite ordinary, really, but for the heady rush of power that comes of sitting in it.
  
  The command chair includes some casters.
  
  >[2] x computer
  The computer is so large that you would be unable to operate it all from one position. Alas, it does not come with a manual.
  
  The Universe Management Computer includes a chartreuse indicator light, an ennui meter, a golden knob settable to 15,000 positions, a toothpick dispenser and a button labeled RESTART.
  
  >[3] x ennui meter
  You can't be bothered.
