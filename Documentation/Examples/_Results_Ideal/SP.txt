  Red Spot
  You are in the middle of a vast red oval plain. Overhead, the thick Jovian clouds swirl menacingly, and a fine acrid dust falls instead of rain.

  >[1] n
  As you once told Cadet Lucky, Jupiter's a mighty big planet, maybe bigger than Iowa. Why, the Red Spot alone stretches out almost to the horizon.
  
  >[2] i
  You are carrying:
    a silver uniform (being worn)
    rubber boots (being worn)
    a shovel
    an Analscope
  
  >[3] x me
  Your hair clumps together stickily, thanks to the dustfall.
  
  >[4] x dust
  The rust-colored dust coats every surface. You've no idea how deep it goes.
  
  >[5] dig dust
  You brush aside the dust underfoot and -- what were the odds? -- it turns out that you landed just where the previous landing party did, thirteen ill-fated years ago. Here is the metal plate that covers their original well.
  
  But wait! Called by the clanging of your shovel on the plate, a band of Jovian pterodactyls swoop down to attack! You're totally defenceless! You don't have a hope! You're absolutely finished!
