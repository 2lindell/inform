  The horse stalls are empty: you have already drained the animals, and carried off their corpses. The house will not long sustain you now.

  The stalls for horses run down one side of the room, but the house has long stood empty. A square window without shutters looks out over the ranch, away toward the Sierras.
  
  Maleska watches you from eyes entirely black.
