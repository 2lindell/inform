  Beneath Roxane's Balcony
  Christian stands in a spot of moonlight and tries to avoid too obviously glancing at the shadows that conceal you.
  
  Above you in the night is Roxane.

  >[1] christian, ask roxane about love
  "So," says Christian nervously to Roxane. "Did you know about love?" But Roxane merely seems puzzled.
  
  >[2] christian, say your breath smells like ripe taleggio to roxane
  "Roxane, your breath smells like ripe taleggio."
  
  Roxane, deeply moved by this sentiment, invites Christian up to her balcony. He scrambles up the ivy and disappears into her bedroom; the last thing you hear is a girlish giggle from above.
  
  Empty Street
  No one is about at this hour, all alone under a pale moon.
  
  You find yourself kicking fenceposts quite without thinking about it.
