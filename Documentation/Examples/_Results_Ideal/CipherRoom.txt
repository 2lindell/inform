  Black Chamber
  Despite its menacing name, it is quite an ordinary room, underlying the post office above. Here letters are brought each day, unsealed, transcribed, resealed, and sent again on their way; their contents then analyzed and recorded.
  
  A woman whose name has never been disclosed to you sits at the window, writing numbers on a sheet of paper.
  
  You can also see a safe box (closed) here.
