  Town Square
  Dense traffic snarls the streets, making it difficult to cross even with the lights. Men on motorbikes edge between the cars, and sometimes pull up onto the sidewalks to go around.
  
  Under the cars in the middle of the street, you can just make out the cover of the manhole you need to get into.
