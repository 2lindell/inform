  Zeta Proximan Dig Field
  During the day, the field is massed with sweating native workers, overseers, and officials from central command. Now the spades, trowels, brushes, metal detectors, ground probes, plumb lines, and sighting tripods have been laid aside.
  
  All that remains are the trenches and the fine grey dust that blows slowly across them; the moonlight; and the just-emerging outlines of an ancient and alien wall.
  
  You can see a hovercraft (on which is a roller board (on which is a heavy golden idol)) here.
