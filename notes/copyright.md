# Licencing and copyright policy

Except as noted, copyright in material in this repository (the "Package") is
held by Graham Nelson (the "Author"), who retains copyright so that there is
a single point of reference. On 28 April 2022, the Package was placed under the
[Artistic License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0).

This is a highly permissive licence, used by Perl among other notable projects,
recognised by the Open Source Initiative as open and by the Free Software
Foundation as free in both senses.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Author makes the further grant that users of
the Package may make unlimited use of story files produced by the Package:
such story files are not derivative works of Inform and do not inherit the
Artistic License 2.0 as an obligation. (This further grant follows the
practice of projects like `bison`, which also copy substantial code into
their outputs.)

A condition of any pull-request being made (i.e., to make suggested amendments
to this software) is that, if the request is accepted, copyright on any contribution
made by it immediately transfers to the project's copyright-holder, Graham Nelson.
This is in order that there can be clear ownership. It does not apply to the
programs duplicated here from other repositories (such as dumb-frotz) or to the
Inform GUI apps: those have their own copyrights and licences.
