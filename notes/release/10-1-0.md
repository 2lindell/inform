# Release notes for Inform v10.1.0

This release was made in August 2022. Bug reports were at this time tracked
at Jira, with issue numbers written I7-NNNN, but Mantis issue numbers
continued to be used for bugs fixed before the move to Jira, so that this
log contains some of each.

## Overview

This first release built on the entirely rewritten Inform code-base contains
relatively little change in the language specification, but the move to an
Inter-based architecture, together with full support for command-line tools,
results in many new lower-level features.

Because of the scale of internal disruption since [version 9.3](9-3.md), an
exhaustive list of small changes is difficult to compile. Past release notes
have served as interim documentation on new facilities, but this repository
now provides all of that more easily. In particular:

- The entire source base has been [published as a literate program here](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/).
- The compiler is now available as three command-line tools:
	- `inbuild`, the new build manager, has a [manual here](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inbuild/M-ui.html);
	- `inform7`, the compiler proper, has its [manual here](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inform7/M-cu.html);
	- `inter`, a code-generator and linker for Inter code, has [a third manual here](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inter/M-ui.html).
- Internally, two major new concepts have arrived:
	- [Inter](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inter/M-ti.html), a new intermediate
	representation used inside the compiler;
	- [kits](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inbuild/M-agtk.html), which evolved
	from the old concept of "template files" and "template code".
- The old Standard Rules extension has been divided in two: one half called
	Basic Inform, which sets up the language itself, and another containing
	the world model and its actions, still called the Standard Rules. Basic
	projects can be compiled which do not use the Standard Rules at all, and
	have no command loop.
- The new Inter architecture allows for multiple possible compilation targets,
	and in particular Inform source text can now be compiled to C instead of
	I6 code, though only at the command line (the apps do not use C).
	See the documentation on [calling Inform from C](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inform7/M-cifc.html).

Inform release notes have historically also included brief release notes on new
features and bug fixes in the apps for Windows, MacOS and Linux. But those have
their own repositories, and their own release notes, so from now on these
core Inform release notes will only mention major app changes.

## Inweb version

Inform's one build dependency is the [Inweb literate programming system](https://github.com/ganelson/inweb).
At the time of this release, the current Inweb version was 7.2.0.

## Language changes

As noted, there are surprisingly few changes to the outward-facing language
since [version 9.3](9-3.md).

- The semantic versioning standard, see [semver.org](semver.org), has been
	adopted throughout the Inform tools, and in particular is what `inbuild`
	uses internally. As part of that, extensions can now give any valid
	Inform semver as their version numbers. See [this implementation](https://ganelson.github.io/inweb/foundation-module/7-vn.html)
	for exactly what the rules are, but there won't be anything surprising.
	Past extension version numbers in the form `9` or `9/861022` are automatically
	converted to `9.0.0` or `9.0.861022` as a semver, but are still legal.
	So for example this:
	```
	Version 3.1.4 of Sliced Pie by Marvin Dougal begins here.
	```
	is now legal in the opening declaration of an extension, and
	```
	Include version 3.1 of Sliced Pie by Marvin Dougal.
	```
	is legal as a way to include that extension. The Inform build manager
	`inbuild` allows v3.1.4 to be used to meet a request for v3.1 because
	semver rules say that it ought to be compatible. See the
	[inbuild manual](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inbuild/M-ui.html) for
	how to store multiple versions of the same extension side-by-side.

- When I6-syntax material is spliced into Inform source text with the
	`Include (- ... -)` construction, that material now has to comply with
	the same rules applying to the source code for kits, also written in an
	I6 syntax. In both cases, the material in question is no longer being
	compiled to Z-code or Glulx virtual machine assembly language by `inform6`;
	it is now being compiled to Inter intermediate code by a completely
	different mechanism in `inter`. Most of the time users will never notice
	the difference, and in any case `Include (- ... -)` is an expert-level
	feature really only intended for complex extensions. However, there are
	a handful of differences because `inter` does not quite read the entire
	range of syntax which `inform6` does. Of these, the most significant are:
	- Only new-style `for` loops with colons in the header, `for (i=0: i<10: i++)`,
		are allowed: not the old style with semicolons, `for (i=0; i<10; i++)`.
		Changing the semicolons to colons fixes any problems.
	- To `inform6`, local variable names are allowed to coincide with statement
		names: thus you can have a local called `style` even though this is also
		a statement keyword. `inter` does not allow this and all such words
		are reserved. The workaround is simply to rename the local in question.
	- The `indirect(...)` function, never really documented but used in a number
		of old template files, cannot be used with `inter`.	But since `indirect(A)`
		is equivalent to `A()`, which does work, this is easy to avoid.

- The `Include (- ... -)` construction previously provided a way to specify
	where an inclusion should occur - before or after certain headings or
	template files. Those syntaxes have all been removed, since they now have
	no meaning. (They assumed the code would always be literally spliced together
	into an Inform 6 output file: this is now far from true.) So, for example,
	```
	Include (- ... -) before "Parser.i6t".
	```
	now has no meaning; `Parser.i6t` no longer even exists, and there's no
	sense of ordering in any case. In practice the code-generator is now much
	better at avoiding code-ordering issues, and this removes any need for
	inclusions to be before or after anything, so just deleting those words
	will usually make everything okay:
	```
	Include (- ... -) before "Parser.i6t".
	```
	However, `instead of` is more problematic. This was typically used by
	extensions to replace a function inside one of the old template files with
	a new implementation. That remains possible, but must be written differently:
	```
	Include (-
		[ BadOldFunction;
			print "This is my deluxe new version!^";
		];
	-) replacing "BadOldFunction".
	```
	In fact this also works for variable and constant names, among other forms
	of declaration. In each case, though, the idea is to supply a different
	declaration for the same Inter symbol, which has to be a symbol defined
	in one of the kits.

- Suppose that the main source text creates a command verb `PURLOIN`: this
	clashes with the definition of `PURLOIN` made by `CommandParserKit`, a testing
	command intended not to play any part in actual play. In previous versions
	of Inform, such clashes were annoying enough that authors generally had to
	avoid those command verbs entirely. But Inform now automatically detects
	clashes of this sort, and silently changes the debugging command by putting
	an exclamation mark `!` in front. In this example `PURLOIN` would have the
	meaning in the source text, and `!PURLOIN` the meaning in the kit. Note
	that preference is given to non-meta commands (i.e., those affecting the
	world model) over testing commands.

- In text substitutions, a local variable name is preferred over an adaptive
	verb; e.g. if `index` is both the name of a local variable and also the
	infinite of a verb `to index`, so that text such as `"Consider [index]."`
	is ambiguous - print the value of the variable, or print an inflected
	form of the verb? - Inform will now give the local variable name priority,
	on the general grounds that local definitions should override global ones.

- Adjective inflection in English has been improved: thus
	- `big` to the comparative `bigger` and superlative `biggest`
	- `long` to the quantity `length`

- A new "can't insert what's already inserted rule" has been added to the
	Standard Rules; which does what it says on the tin.

- For phrases which refer to things "in" a list, the preposition "from" can
	now be used instead. Thus `remove X in L` and `remove X from L` are
	equivalent, as are `number of entries in L` and `number of entries from L`,
	and so on.

- Numerous maxima have been removed (for example, the limit on object name length
	has gone), or raised (for example, the limit on quoted text length was raised to 8K).

- The `Options.txt` file, if used, is now expected to be encoded as UTF-8, not
	ISO Latin-1. In practice it almost always contains ASCII characters anyway.

- When compiling via I6, the `STRIP_UNREACHABLE_LABELS` and `OMIT_UNUSED_ROUTINES`
	features (fairly newly available in the `inform6` compiler) are now enabled,
	and eliminate a great deal of unnecessary code. This can reduce the size of
	resulting Z-machine story files, where economy matters, by 10-20% (though
	the saving is all from the code area, not addressable data, which tends to
	be the more serious constraint).

- The extension `Glulx Entry Points by Emily Short` has been removed from the
	core distribution because it is unlikely to be helpful for modern Glk users:
	we hope to provide better facilities in a future release of Inform. In the
	mean time, the final state of GEP, 10/150101, has been added to the v10
	version of the Public Library for people who still need it for older projects.

## Bug fixes

Since this release comes after a long period of reconstruction and code review,
there's not really any way to itemise every bug fix: many little bugs were fixed
which hadn't been seen in the wild, so far as we know. But the following are the
most important 150 or so, which were indeed reported, and for which issue numbers
at our tracker and commits can be identified.
