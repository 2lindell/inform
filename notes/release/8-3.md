# Release notes for Inform v8.3 (build 6F92)

This release was made on 17 October 2010, before Inform was open-sourced.
At that time bugs were tracked by a Mantis server, with seven-digit issue numbers,
and versions of Inform were identified by build codes in the form NLNN.
Suggestion numbers, also large but not starting with a 0, referred to tickets at
a Uservoice forum then in use.

This is part of the [historical archive of release notes](../version_history.md).

## Overview

This is a private test build released a few days in advance of v8.4, and the
change log is given in full [there](8-4.md).
