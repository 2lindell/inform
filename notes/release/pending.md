These will be added to release notes when the release is made.

## Features

- This was reported as Jira bug [I7-2087](https://inform7.atlassian.net/browse/I7-2087)
	"three anonymous standard rules", but is arguably a feature request: that three
	rules in the Standard Rules should have names. All three are simple rules, two
	of them occurring early and late in the turn cycle to consider whether a scene
	change has happened, and one as the fallback rule making an action succeed if
	no rules have intervened in the process.
	```
	early scene changing stage
	late scene changing stage
	default action success rule
	```

- Fix for a "very old quirk of I7 where it generates a `story.gblorb.js` file for
