# Inform 7 version 7.10.1 'Krypton' (build 6Q21)

## About Inform 7

Inform 7 (April 2006-) is a programming language for creating interactive
fiction, using natural language syntax. Using natural language and drawing on
ideas from linguistics and from literate programming, Inform is widely
used as a medium for literary writing, as a prototyping tool in the games
industry, and in education, both at school and university level (where
Inform is often assigned material for courses on digital narrative).
It has twice ranked in the top 100 most influential programming languages
according to the TIOBE index.

## Licence

Except as noted, copyright in material in this repository (the "Package") is
held by Graham Nelson (the "Author"), who retains copyright so that there is
a single point of reference. As from the first date of this repository
becoming public, the Package is placed under the [Artistic License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0).
This is a highly permissive licence, used by Perl among other notable projects,
recognised by the Open Source Initiative as open and by the Free Software
Foundation as free in both senses.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Author makes the further grant that users of
the Package may make unlimited use of story files produced by the Package:
such story files are not derivative works of Inform and do not inherit the
Artistic License 2.0 as an obligation. (This further grant follows the
practice of projects like bison, which also copy substantial code into
their outputs.)

## Repositories

This is the "core repository", holding source code for the compiler, and
for everything needed to run it on the command line. However:

* To build and test the compiler you also need Inweb and Intest, programs
spun out from the Inform project. These are __not included in the core
repository either as submodules or copies__, and have their own repositories.
If you are new to Inform core development, begin by cloning and building Inweb
as a stand-alone tool, then use that to build Intest, then return here.
	* [https://github.com/ganelson/inweb](https://github.com/ganelson/inweb), maintained by [Graham Nelson](https://github.com/ganelson)
	* [https://github.com/ganelson/intest](https://github.com/ganelson/intest), maintained by [Graham Nelson](https://github.com/ganelson)
* Most Inform authors use Inform as an app: for example, it is available
on the Mac App Store. While much of the UI design is the same across all
platforms, each app has its own code in its own repository. See:

## Build Instructions

Make a directory in which to work: let's call this "work". Then:

* Clone and build Inweb into "work/inweb".
* Clone and build Intest into "work/intest".
* Clone Inform into "work/inform". Change the current directory to that.
Then run "bash scripts/first.sh" (or whatever shell you prefer: it need
not be bash). This should give you a complete working set of command-line
Inform tools and associated makefiles. For any future builds, you can simply
type "make".
* For a simple test, try e.g. "inblorb/Tangled/inblorb -help". All the
executables should similarly respond to -help.
* But for a true test, run "make check". This compiles two more tools needed
only for testing (dumb-frotz and dumb-glulx), then runs Intest on each tool
in turn. Some haven't got a test suite, some have; it will run whatever it
finds. Be advised that on a 2013 laptop this all takes quarter of an hour and
sounds like a helicopter taking off.

## Inventory

"I can't help feeling that if someone had asked me before the universe began
how it would turn out, I should have guessed something a bit less like an old
curiosity shop and a bit more like a formal French garden â€” an orderly
arrangement of straight avenues, circular walks, and geometrically shaped
trees and hedges." (Michael Frayn)

Inform is not a single program: while the Inform 7 compiler builds to a single
executable file, this is only useful in concert with other tools (notably the
Inform 6 compiler and the Inblorb packager), with standard libraries of code
(called Extensions), with documentation, test cases and so on. This repository
assembles all those programs and resources, which fall into two categories:

### Resources for which this is the primary repository

This repository is where development is done on the following:

* inform7 - The core compiler in a natural-language design system for interactive fiction. Current version 7.10.1 'Krypton' (build 6Q21). Web of InC

Notes:

1. The "webs" above are literate programs. This means they can either be
"tangled" to executables, or "woven" to human-readable forms. The woven
forms can [all be browsed here](docs/webs.html). They aim to be much easier
to understand than raw source code found by spelunking through the repository.
2. "InC" is a slight extension of ANSI C99. These extensions are handled by
Inweb, which acts as a preprocessor. For more on InC, see the Inweb manual.
