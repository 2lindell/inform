            <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

            <p>This phrase displays the given text on screen in an overlaid box. For reasons to do with the way such quotations are plotted onto the screen, their text is treated literally: no substitutions in square brackets are obeyed. The quo ation will only ever appear once, regardless of the number of times the &quot;display the boxed quotation ...&quot; phrase is reached. Rather than being shown immediately - and thus, probably, scrolling away before it can be seen - the display is held back until the next command prompt is shown to the player. Example:</p>
            <!--START CODE "c6"-->
            <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c6"></a>After looking in the Wabe, display the boxed quotation

            <p>&quot;How so? How can it affect them?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; replied his wife, &quot;how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Is that his design in settling here?&quot;</p>
            <p><img alt="skt1.png" src="images/skt1.png" class="bordered" /></p>
            <p>&quot;Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;They have none of them much to recommend them,&quot; replied he; &quot;they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.&quot;</p>
            <p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</p>

                    <p>This is the first of about 400 numbered examples. In a few cases, such as this one, they provide a little background information, but almost all demonstrate Inform source text. The techniques demonstrated tend to be included either because they are frequently asked for, or because they show how to achieve some interesting effect.</p>
                    <p>In most cases, typing the single command TEST ME will play through a few moves to show off the effect being demonstrated. (You may find it convenient to create a &quot;scratch&quot; project file for temporary trials like this, clearing all its text and starting again with each new test.)</p>
                    <p>As part of the testing process which verifies a new build of Inform, each example in turn is extracted from this documentation, translated, played through, and the resulting transcript mechanically checked. So the examples may even work as claimed. But the flesh is weak, and there are bound to be glitches. We would welcome reports, so that future editions can be corrected.</p>
                    <p>Each example is loosely graded by difficulty: if they were exercises in a textbook, the asterisks would indicate how many marks each question scores. As a general rule:</p>
