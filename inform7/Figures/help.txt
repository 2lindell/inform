  -pipeline-file X    specify code-generation pipeline as file X
  -variable X         set pipeline variable X (in form name=value)

for testing and debugging inform7:
  -crash-all          intentionally crash on Problem messages, for backtracing (default is -no-crash-all)
  -no-index           don't produce an Index (default is -index)
  -no-progress        don't display progress percentages (default is -progress)

-help                 print this help information
-log X                write the debugging log to include diagnostics on X
-version              print out version number
