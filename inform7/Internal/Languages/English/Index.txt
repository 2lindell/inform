%Index.Elements.Ch.Plural = plural

%Index.Elements.Ch.DefaultColumn = default value
%Index.Elements.Ch.RepeatColumn = repeat
%Index.Elements.Ch.PropsColumn = props
%Index.Elements.Ch.UnderColumn = under

%Index.Elements.Ch.DefaultGloss = 
	The <b>default value</b> is used when we make something like 
	a variable but don't tell Inform what its value is. For instance, if 
	we write 'Zero hour is a time that varies', but don't tell Inform 
	anything specific like 'Zero hour is 11:21 PM.', then Inform uses 
	the value in the table above to decide what it will be. 
	The same applies if we create a property (for instance, 'A person 
	has a number called lucky number.'). Kinds of value not included 
	in the table cannot be used in variables and properties.
%Index.Elements.Ch.RepeatGloss = 
	A tick for <b>repeat</b> means that it's possible to 
	repeat through values of this kind. For instance, 'repeat with T 
	running through times:' is allowed, but 'repeat with N running 
	through numbers:' is not - there are too many numbers for this to 
	make sense. A tick here also means it's possible to form lists such 
	as 'list of rulebooks', or to count the 'number of scenes'.
%Index.Elements.Ch.PropsGloss = 
	A tick for <b>props</b> means that values of this 
	kind can have properties. For instance, 'A scene can be thrilling or 
	dull.' makes an either/or property of a scene, but 'A number can be 
	nice or nasty.' is not allowed because it would cost too much storage 
	space. (Of course 'Definition:' can always be used to make adjectives 
	applying to numbers; it's only properties which have storage 
	worries.)
%Index.Elements.Ch.UnderGloss = 
	A tick for <b>under</b> means that it's possible 
	to understand values of this kind. For instance, 'Understand "award 
	[number]" as awarding.' might be allowed, if awarding were an action 
	applying to a number, but 'Understand "run [rule]" as rule-running.' 
	is not allowed - there are so many rules with such long names that 
	Inform doesn't add them to its vocabulary during play.
%Index.Elements.Ch.CovarianceGloss =
	<b>Covariance</b> means that if K is a kind of L, then something
	you make from K can be used as the same thing made from L. For example,
	a list of doors can be used as a list of things, because 'list of K' is
	covariant. <b>Contravariance</b> means it works the other way round.
	For example, an activity on things can be used as an activity on doors,
	but not vice versa, because 'activity of K' is contravariant.
