Character Set Template.

Code relating to the Unicode character set.

@ The following are the equivalent of |tolower| and |toupper|, the traditional
C library functions for forcing letters into lower and upper case form, for
the 32-bit architecture's character set. That's now Unicode, and we delegate
all of the work to glk functions.

=
[ VM_UpperToLowerCase c; return glk_char_to_lower(c); ];
[ VM_LowerToUpperCase c; return glk_char_to_upper(c); ];
