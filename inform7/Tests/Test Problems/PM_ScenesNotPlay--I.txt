Problem__ PM_ScenesNotPlay
  >--> You wrote 'Train Stop ends when play ends' (source text, line 3): but
    'play' is not really a scene, so although you can write '... when play
    begins' you cannot write '... when play ends'. But there's no need to do
    so, anyway. When play ends, all scenes end.
