  >--> In the sentence 'if 21 is nowhere' (source text, line 4), it looks as if
    you intend '21 is nowhere' to be a condition, but that seems to say that a
    value - specifically, a number - is nowhere. To Inform, nowhere means 'in
    no room', and only things can be nowhere. (For instance, 'Godot is
    nowhere.' is allowed - it means Godot exists, but is not initially part of
    the drama.)
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (21 is nowhere - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    21 is nowhere = a condition
