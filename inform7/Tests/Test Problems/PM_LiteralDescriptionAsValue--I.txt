  >--> You wrote 'let D be even numbers' (source text, line 5), but 'even
    numbers' is used in a context where I'd expect to see a (single) specific
    example of a value, not a description.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (d - a new name) be (even numbers - description of relations of
    values) 
    2.  let (d - a new name) be (even numbers - name of kind) 
    3.  let (d - a new name) be (even numbers - value) 
    4.  let (d - a temporary named value) be (even numbers - value) 
    I recognised:
    d = a temporary named value, holding a description of numbers
    even numbers = a description of numbers

  >--> You wrote 'say the time' (source text, line 6), but 'time' is used in a
    context where I'd expect to see a (single) specific example of an object,
    not a description. (If you meant the current time, this is called 'time of
    day' in Inform to avoid confusing it with the various other meanings that
    the word 'time' can have.)
