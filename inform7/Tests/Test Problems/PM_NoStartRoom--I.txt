  >--> There doesn't seem to be any location in this story, so there's nowhere
    for the player to begin. This may be because I have misunderstood what was
    meant to be a room and what wasn't: I only know something is a room if you
    tell me explicitly ('The Observatory is a room') or if you imply it by
    giving map directions ('East of the Observatory is the Planetarium').
