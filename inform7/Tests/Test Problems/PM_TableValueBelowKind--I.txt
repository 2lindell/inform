Problem__ PM_TableValueBelowKind
  >--> In 'Table of Whoops' (source text, line 5), column 1 (fruit), the entry
    'pear' (source text, line 8) (row 2) is a genuine, non-blank entry: it's a
    specific value. That's fine, of course - the whole idea of a table is to
    contain values - but this is a column which already contains a name of a
    kind: 'thing' (source text, line 7). Names of kinds are only allowed at
    the top of otherwise blank columns: they tell me what might eventually go
    there. So the kind name has to go. You can replace it with a blank '--',
    and then either let me deduce the kind by myself, working it out from the
    actual values in the column, or you can put the kind in brackets after the
    column's name, at the top.)
