  >--> You wrote 'Chapter of Minimal Grammar (in place of Part Six - Grammar in
    Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 3): but these headings
    are not of the same level, so it is not possible to make the replacement.
    (Level here means being a Volume, Book, Part, Chapter or Section: for
    instance, only a Chapter heading can be used 'in place of' a Chapter.)
Inform 7 has finished: 10 centiseconds used.
