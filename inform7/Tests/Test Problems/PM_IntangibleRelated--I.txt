  >--> You wrote 'In the box is closed' (source text, line 1): but this seems
    to give a worldly relationship to something intangible, like saying that
    'in the box is a text'. Perhaps it came to this because you gave something
    physical a name which was accidentally something meaningful to me in
    another context? If so, you may be able to get around it by rewording ('In
    the box is a medieval text') or in extremis by using 'called' ('In the box
    is a thing called text').
