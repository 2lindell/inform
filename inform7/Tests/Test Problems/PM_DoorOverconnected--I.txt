  >--> Great Gate seems to be a door with three ways out (specified 'The Great
    Gate is south of the Taj Mahal' (source text, line 2), 'The Great Gate is
    west of the Temple' (source text, line 4) and 'The Great Gate is east of
    the Grassy Slope' (source text, line 3)), but you can only have one or two
    sides to a door in Inform: a one-sided door means a door which is only
    touchable and usable from one side, and an example might be a window
    through which one falls to the ground below. If you really need a
    three-sided cavity, best to make it a room in its own right.
