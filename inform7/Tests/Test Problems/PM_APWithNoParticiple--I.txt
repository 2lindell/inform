  >--> You wrote 'Instead of arfle barfle gloop' (source text, line 3), which
    seems to introduce a rule taking effect only 'arfle barfle gloop'. But this
    does not look like an action, since there is no sign of a participle ending
    '-ing' (as in 'taking the brick', say) - which makes me think I have badly
    misunderstood what you intended.
