  >--> You wrote 'A Renaissance portrait is a kind of Mona Lisa' (source text, line 3):
    but kinds can only be made from other kinds, so 'a kind of container' is
    allowed but 'a kind of Mona Lisa' (where Mona Lisa is a specific thing
    you've already made), wouldn't be allowed. There is only one Mona Lisa.
