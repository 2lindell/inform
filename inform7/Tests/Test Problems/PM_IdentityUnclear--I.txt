  >--> The sentence 'A vehicle is the Sydney Opera House' (source text, line 3)
    seems to tell me that 'vehicle' and 'Sydney Opera House' have to be the
    same, but it looks odd to me. 'vehicle' is something generic - not
    something definite; but 'Sydney Opera House' is (presumably) something
    specific. So it's as if you'd written 'A room is the Sydney Opera House'.
    (Which room, exactly? You see the trouble.)
