Problem__ PM_EquatesSomethingToValue
  >--> You wrote 'Something called mauve is a colour' (source text, line 5):
    but that seems to say that an object is the same as a value, which must be
    wrong. This can happen if the word 'something' is used loosely - I read it
    as 'some thing', so I think it has to refer to a thing, which is a kind of
    object. A sentence like 'Something called mauve is a colour' trips me up
    because mauve is a value, so it isn't an object, and doesn't match
    'something'.
