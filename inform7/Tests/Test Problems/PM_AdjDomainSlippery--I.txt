  >--> In 'An open door is wibbly if it is 100 years old' (source text, line 3)
    you defined an adjective by 'An open door is wibbly if it is 100 years old'
    intending that it would apply to 'An open door': but this is slippery,
    because it can change during play. Definitions can only be made in cases
    where it's clear for any given value or object what definition will apply.
    For instance, 'Definition: a door is shiny if ...' is fine, but
    'Definition: an open door is shiny if ...' is not allowed - Inform wouldn't
    know whether or not to apply it to the Big Blue Door (say), since it would
    only apply some of the time.
Inform 7 has finished.
