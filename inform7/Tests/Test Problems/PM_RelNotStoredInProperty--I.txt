  >--> You wrote 'Partnership relates one number to another (called the
    partner)' (source text, line 3): but a '(called ...)' name can't be used
    for this relation, because of the kinds involved in it. (Names for terms in
    a relation only work if it's possible to store the relation using
    properties, but that's impossible here, so Inform uses a different scheme.)
