  >--> You wrote 'To amalgamate (N - a number) (M - a number)' (source text, line 3):
    but phrases can't be defined so that they have two bracketed varying
    elements immediately next to each other, but instead need at least one
    fixed word in between. Thus 'To combine (X - a number) (Y - a number)' is
    not allowed, but 'To combine (X - a number) with (Y - a number)' works
    because of the 'with' dividing the bracketed terms X and Y.
