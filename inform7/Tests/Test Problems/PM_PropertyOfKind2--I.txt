  >--> In the sentence 'decrease the carrying capacity of a container by 1' (source
    text, line 4), it looks as if you intend 'carrying capacity of a container'
    to be a property, but 'a container' is not specific enough about who or
    what the owner is. Sometimes this mistake is made because Inform mostly
    doesn't understand the English language habit of referring to something
