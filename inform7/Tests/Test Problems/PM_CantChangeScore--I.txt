Problem__ PM_CantChangeScore
  >--> You wrote 'now the score is 7' (source text, line 4): but this is a
    story with no scoring, so it makes no sense to change the 'score' value.
    You can add scoring to the story by including the sentence 'Use scoring.',
    in which case this problem message will go away; or you can remove it with
    'Use no scoring.' (Until 2011, the default was to have scoring, but now
    it's not to have scoring.)
