  >--> You wrote 'A cooker can be a supporter' (source text, line 1): but this
    tries to create a new either/or adjective with the same name as an existing
    kind, which isn't allowed. For example, 'A hopper can be a container.' is
    not allowed because something either is, or is not, a 'container', and that
    can never change during play. 'Container' is a kind, and those are fixed.
    'A hopper is a container' would be allowed, because that makes a definite
    statement.
