  >--> In 'a sayable value is green if it is 0' (source text, line 2) you
    defined an adjective by 'a sayable value is green if it is 0' intending
    that it would apply to 'a sayable value': but this isn't allowed as the
    domain of a definition, since it potentially describes many different
    kinds, not just one.
