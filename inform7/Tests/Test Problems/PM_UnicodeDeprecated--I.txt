Problem__ PM_UnicodeDeprecated
  >--> You wrote 'At sigil translates into Unicode as 64' (source text, line 1):
    but the sentence 'X translates into Unicode as Y' has been removed from the
    Inform language, because it is now redundant. Inform already knows all the
    names in the Unicode standard. If you're getting this problem message
    because you included the extension 'Unicode Full Character Names' or
    'Unicode Character Names', all you need do is to not include it.
Inform 7 has finished.
