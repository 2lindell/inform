Problem__ PM_CantContainAndSupport
  >--> You wrote 'On the table is a flower' (source text, line 3), but in
    another sentence 'In the table is a petal' (source text, line 3): table
    cannot both contain things and support things, which is what you're
    implying here. If you need both, the easiest way is to make it either a
    supporter with a container attached or vice versa. For instance: 'A desk is
    here. On the desk is a newspaper. An openable container called the drawer
    is part of the desk. In the drawer is a stapler.'
