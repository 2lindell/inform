Problem__ PM_UnexpectedDialogue
  >--> The text 'The claw is here .' (source text, line 5) appears under a
    section heading marked as dialogue, so it needs to be either a cue in
    brackets '(like this.)', or else a line of dialogue 'Speaker: "Something to
    say!"'. It doesn't seem to be either of those.
Inform 7 has finished.
