Problem__ PM_MisbracketedDialogueClause
  >--> The text 'About (ghosts .' (source text, line 5) appears to be a
    bracketed clause to do with dialogue, but the punctuation looks wrong
    because it uses brackets '(' and ')' in a way which doesn't match. There
    should be just one outer pair of brackets, and inside they can only be used
    to clarify clauses, if necessary.
Problem__ PM_MisbracketedDialogueClause
  >--> The text 'slowly, quickly) (erroneously' (source text, line 7) appears
    to be a bracketed clause to do with dialogue, but the punctuation looks
    wrong because it uses brackets '(' and ')' in a way which doesn't match.
    There should be just one outer pair of brackets, and inside they can only
    be used to clarify clauses, if necessary.
Problem__ PM_MisbracketedDialogueClause
  >--> The text 'going (doolally' (source text, line 9) appears to be a
    bracketed clause to do with dialogue, but the punctuation looks wrong
    because it uses brackets '(' and ')' in a way which doesn't match. There
    should be just one outer pair of brackets, and inside they can only be used
    to clarify clauses, if necessary.
Problem__ PM_UnexpectedDialogue
  >--> The text 'Horatio blindly): "That!"' (source text, line 11) appears
    under a section heading marked as dialogue, so it needs to be either a cue
    in brackets '(like this.)', or else a line of dialogue 'Speaker: "Something
    to say!"'. It doesn't seem to be either of those.
Inform 7 has finished.
