  >--> You wrote '"He's green."' (source text, line 3): but the property
    indefinite appearance text for the Kermit is not allowed, i.e., you can't
    write a double-quoted piece of text as a sentence all by itself here. Some
    kinds or kinds of value are allowed this - objects and scenes, for instance
    - but most are not. (They would need to provide a 'description' property.)
