  >--> The sentence 'Green is a colour' (source text, line 2) reads to me as if
    'Green' refers to something I should create as brand new - a colour. But
    that can't be right, because this is a kind of value where I can't simply
    invent new values. (Just as the numbers are ..., 1, 2, 3, ... and I can't
    invent a new one called 'Susan'.)
