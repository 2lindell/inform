Problem__ PM_VagueVariable
  >--> You wrote 'The Afghan shepherd is a variable' (source text, line 3): but
    'variable' is too vague a description, because it doesn't say what kind of
    value should go into the variable. 'number variable' or 'a number that
    varies' - whatever kind of value you need - would be much clearer.
