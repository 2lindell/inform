  >--> You wrote 'Two men called Fred and George are here' (source text, line 3):
    but I can only make a single 'called' thing at a time, or rather, the
    'called' is only allowed to apply to one thing at a time. For instance, 'A
    thing called a vodka and tonic is on the table.' is allowed, but 'Two
    things called vodka and tonic' is not.
