  >--> You wrote 'Instead of pushing Wellington or pushing Orinoco' (source
    text, line 3), which seems to introduce a rule, but the circumstances
    ('pushing Wellington or pushing Orinoco') seem to be too general for me to
    understand in a single rule. I can understand a choice of actions, in a
    list such as 'taking or dropping the ball', but there can only be one set
    of noun(s) supplied. So 'taking the ball or taking the bat' is disallowed.
    You can get around this by using named actions ('Taking the ball is being
    mischievous. Taking the bat is being mischievous. Instead of being
    mischievous...'), or it may be less bother just to write more than one
    rule.
Inform 7 has finished.
