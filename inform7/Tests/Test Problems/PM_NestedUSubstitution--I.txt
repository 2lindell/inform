  >--> You wrote 'say "NEW YORK. 1832.[[unicode 182]]I had just..."' (source
    text, line 3): but the text here contains one substitution '[...]' inside
    another, which is not allowed. Actually, it looks as if you might have got
    into this by typing an exotic character as part of the name of a text
    substitution - those get rewritten automatically as '[unicode N]' for the
    appropriate Unicode character code number N. Either way - this isn't
    allowed.
