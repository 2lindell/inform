Problem__ PM_UnderstandCommaCommand
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "take []" as taking' (source text, line 1): but
    'understand' as an action cannot involve a comma, since a command leading
    to an action never does. (Although Inform understands commands like 'PETE,
    LOOK' only the part after the comma is read as an action command: the part
    before the comma is read as the name of someone, according to the usual
    rules for parsing a name.) Because of the way Inform processes text with
    square brackets, this problem message is also sometimes seen if empty
    square brackets are used, as in 'Understand "bless []" as blessing.'
Inform 7 has finished.
