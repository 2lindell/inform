Problem__ PM_TooManyLocals
  >--> You wrote 'To use gratuitous locals with (A - number) and (B - text)' (source
    text, line 3): but there are too many temporarily-named values in this
    phrase, which may be a sign that it is complicated enough to need breaking
    up into smaller phrases making use of each other. The limit is 15 at a time
    for a Z-machine project (see the Settings) and 256 at a time for Glulx.
    That has to include both values created in the declaration of a phrase
    (e.g. the 'N' in 'To deduct (N - a number) points: ...', or the 'watcher'
    in 'Instead of taking something in the presence of a man (called the
    watcher): ...'), and also values created with 'let' or 'repeat' (each
    'repeat' loop claiming two such values) - not to mention one or two values
    occasionally needed to work with Tables. Because of all this, it's best to
    keep the complexity to a minimum within any single phrase.
