  >--> In 'a big number is big if it is 123' (source text, line 2) you defined
    an adjective by 'a big number is big if it is 123' intending that it would
    apply to 'a big number': but this doesn't really define an adjective,
    because it seems to be circular - it is involved in its own definition.
Inform 7 has finished.
