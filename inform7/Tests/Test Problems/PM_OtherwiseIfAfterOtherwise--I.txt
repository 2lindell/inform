Problem__ PM_OtherwiseIfAfterOtherwise
  >--> You wrote 'otherwise' (source text, line 7): but this seems to be
    misplaced since it is out of sequence within its 'if', with an 'otherwise
    if...' coming after the more general 'otherwise' rather than before. (If
    there's an 'otherwise' clause, it has to be the last clause of the 'if'.)
