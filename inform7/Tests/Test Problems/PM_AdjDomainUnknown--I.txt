  >--> In 'A blorgle is wibbly if it is 100 years old' (source text, line 3)
    you defined an adjective by 'A blorgle is wibbly if it is 100 years old'
    intending that it would apply to 'A blorgle': but this isn't a thing, a
    kind of thing or a kind of value, and indeed doesn't have any meaning I can
    make sense of.
Inform 7 has finished.
