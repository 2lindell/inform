Problem__ PM_TableKindBelowValue
  >--> In 'Table of Whoops' (source text, line 5), column 1 (fruit), the entry
    'thing' (source text, line 8) (row 2) is the name of a kind. This isn't a
    specific value. You're allowed to write in the name of a kind like this if
    the column otherwise has blank entries - to tell Inform what might
    eventually go there - but here the column already contains a genuine value
    higher up: 'apple' (source text, line 7). So the kind name has to go. You
    can either let me deduce the kind by myself, working it out from the actual
    values in the column, or you can put the kind in brackets after the
    column's name, at the top.)
