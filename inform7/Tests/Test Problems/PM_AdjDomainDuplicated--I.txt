Problem__ PM_AdjDomainDuplicated
  >--> The definitions 'A thing is a doggie-snack if it is the newspaper' (source
    text, line 11) and 'A thing is a doggie-snack if it is edible' (source text, line 9)
    both try to cover the same situation: the same adjective applied to the
    exact same range. It's okay to override a definition in an extension with
    another one in the main source text, but it's not okay to define the same
    adjective twice over the same domain in the same file.
