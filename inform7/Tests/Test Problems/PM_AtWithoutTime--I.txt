Problem__ PM_AtWithoutTime
  >--> You wrote 'At all events' (source text, line 3): but 'at' what time? No
    description of a time is given, which means that this rule can never have
    effect. (The convention is that any rule beginning 'At' is a timed one. The
    time can either be a fixed time, as in 'At 11:10 AM: ...', or the time when
    some named event takes place, as in 'At the time when the clock chimes:
    ...'.)
