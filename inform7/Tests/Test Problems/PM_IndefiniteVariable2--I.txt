Problem__ PM_IndefiniteVariable2
  >--> I am unable to create 'phrase in question', because the text was too
    vague about what its kind should be - I can see it's a phrase, but not what
    kind of phrase. (You may be able to fix this by declaring the kind directly
    first. For example, rather than 'The magic word is initially my deluxe
    phrase.', something like 'The magic word is a phrase nothing -> nothing
    variable. The magic word is initially my deluxe phrase.')
Inform 7 has finished.
