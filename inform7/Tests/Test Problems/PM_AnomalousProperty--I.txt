Problem__ PM_AnomalousProperty
  >--> Sorry, but I'm going to have to disallow the sentence 'A keyword can be
    pushable between rooms' (source text, line 3), even though it asks for
    something reasonable. A very small number of either-or properties with
    meanings special to Inform, like 'pushable between rooms', are restricted
    so that only kinds of object can have them. Since a keyword isn't a kind of
    object, it can't be said to be pushable between rooms. Probably you only
    need to call the property something else. The built-in meaning would only
    make sense if it were a kind of object in any case, so nothing is lost.
    Sorry for the inconvenience, all the same; there are good implementation
    reasons.
