  >--> You wrote 'Frequency times length specifies a velocity' (source text, line 7):
    but multiplication rules can only be given between kinds of value which are
    known to be numerical, and not all of these are. Saying something like
    'Pressure is a kind of value.' is not enough - you may think 'pressure'
    ought to be numerical, but Inform doesn't know that yet. You need to add
    something like '100 Pa specifies a pressure.' before Inform will realise.
Inform 7 has finished: 16 centiseconds used.
