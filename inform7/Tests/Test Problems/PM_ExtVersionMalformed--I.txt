  >--> You wrote 'Include version / of Standard Rules by Graham Nelson' (source
    text, line 1): but a version number must have the form N/DDDDDD, as in the
    example '2/040426' for release 2 made on 26 April 2004. (The DDDDDD part is
    optional, so '3' is a legal version number too. N must be between 1 and
    999: in particular, there is no version 0.)
