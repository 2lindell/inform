  >--> You wrote 'The Kitchen is adjacent to the Dining Room' (source text, line 1):
    but the relationship you describe is not exact enough, so that I do not
    know how to make this assertion come true. For instance, saying 'The Study
    is adjacent to the Hallway.' is not good enough because I need to know in
    what direction: is it east of the Hallway, perhaps, or west?
