  >--> The sentence 'The bar of the lab is never 42' (source text, line 3)
    looked to me as if it might be trying to say what a property value is not,
    rather than what it is, by using 'never', or 'seldom'. You can only say
    what it is, or for properties of kinds, what it 'usually' is.
Inform 7 has finished.
