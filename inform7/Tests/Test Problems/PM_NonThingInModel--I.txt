  >--> In the sentence 'The floor is a nose' (source text, line 5), you create
    an object 'floor' which you then seem to place in or on or as part of
    'Lab', but the kind of 'floor' is a nose. Since a nose is not a kind of
    thing, it follows that floor is not a thing, so it doesn't represent
    something physical and can't be put in spatial relationships like this.
    (For the same reason that you can't put 'southeast', the direction, inside
    a kitchen cupboard.)
