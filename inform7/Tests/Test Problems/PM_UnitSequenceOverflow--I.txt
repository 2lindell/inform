  >--> You wrote 'A b9 times a b10 specifies a b11' (source text, line 95): but
    reading that sentence led me into calculating such a complicated kind of
    value that I ran out of memory, which my programmer really didn't expect to
    happen. I think you must have made an awful lot of numerical kinds of
    value, and then specified how they multiply so that one of them became
    weirdly tricky. Can you simplify?
