Problem__ PM_InstanceNowKind
  >--> You wrote ''A palace is a kind of room' (source text, line 3)', but that
    seems to say that some room or thing already created ('Winter Palace',
    created by ''The Winter Palace is a room' (source text, line 1)') is now to
    become a kind. To prevent a variety of possible misunderstandings, this is
    not allowed: when a kind is created, the name given has to be a name not so
    far used. (Sometimes this happens due to confusion between names. For
    instance, if a room called 'Marble archway' exists, then Inform reads 'An
    archway is a kind of thing', Inform will read 'archway' as a reference to
    the existing room, not as a new name. To solve this, put the sentences the
    other way round.)
