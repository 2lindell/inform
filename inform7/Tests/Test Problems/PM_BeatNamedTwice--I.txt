Problem__ PM_BeatNamedTwice
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote '(About the paranormal . This is the quaintly done scene .
    This is the doubled beat .)' (source text, line 5): but this dialogue beat
    seems to be named more than once, which is not allowed. It can be
    anonymous, but otherwise can only have one name (either as a beat or as a
    scene, and not both).
Inform 7 has finished.
