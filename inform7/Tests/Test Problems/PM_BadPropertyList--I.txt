  >--> You wrote 'An antique is a kind of thing with an age' (source text, line 1):
    but this looked to me as if it might be trying to create something which
    has certain properties, and that made no sense on investigation. This
    sometimes happens if a sentence uses 'with' a little too liberally, or to
    specify a never-declared property. For instance, 'An antique is a kind of
    thing with an age.' would not be the right way to declare the property
    'age' (because it does not tell Inform what kind of value this would be).
    Instead, try 'An antique is a kind of thing. An antique has a number called
    age.' It would then be all right to say 'The Louis Quinze chair is an
    antique with age 241.'
