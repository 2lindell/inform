Problem__ PM_VariableCantHaveProperties
  >--> The sentence 'The player can be lackadaisical' (source text, line 3)
    looked to me as if it might be trying to create an either/or property which
    would be held by a variable ('The player'). But because 'The player' can
    have different values at different times, it's not clear who or what should
    have the property. The most common case of this is saying something like
    'The player can be ambitious'. 'The player' is actually a variable, because
    the perspective of play can change. Instead either say 'A person can be
    ambitious' or, if you really only want the default player to be involved,
    'Yourself can be ambitious'.
