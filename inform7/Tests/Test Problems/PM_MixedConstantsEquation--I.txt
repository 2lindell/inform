Problem__ PM_EquationMisnumbered
  >--> You wrote 'Equation 1 P = 1 where P is a number' (source text, line 2):
    but the top line of this equation declaration seems not to be a legal
    equation number or name, and should read something like 'Equation 6', or
    'Equation - Newton's Second Law', or 'Equation 41 - Coulomb's Law'.
Problem__ PM_MixedConstantsEquation
  >--> The sentence 'Equation 1 P = 1 where P is a number' (source text, line 2)
    reads to me as if 'Equation 1 P = 1 where P' refers to something I should
    create as brand new - a number. But that can't be right, and I suspect this
    may be because you've tried to create an Equation but not given it a new
    paragraph.
