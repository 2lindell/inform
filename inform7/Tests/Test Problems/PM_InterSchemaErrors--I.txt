  >--> In the sentence 'an object is foo rather than bar if I6 condition
    "("says so (it is broken)' (source text, line 3), you use a fragment of
    code written in Inform 6 syntax which seems to be malformed in some way. I
    delegate all that work to a lesser compiler: I gave it '(()' to compile,
    and it came back with this: 1. unexpected '(' 2. unexpected '(' 3.
    unexpected ')'
Inform 7 has finished.
