Problem__ PM_RelationWithBadProperty
  >--> You wrote 'The verb to be read implies the printed text property' (source
    text, line 3): but that doesn't seem to be a property, perhaps because you
    haven't defined it yet?
Problem__ PM_UnknownPropertyType
  >--> In the sentence 'The verb to be read implies the printed text property' (source
    text, line 3), it looks as if you intend 'The verb to be read implies the
    printed text property' to be asserting something, but that tries to set the
    value of an unknown property to a text.
