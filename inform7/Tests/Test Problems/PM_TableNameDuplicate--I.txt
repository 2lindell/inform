  >--> I can't create 'Table of Craziness' (source text, line 5) because its
    name overlaps with one that already exists: 'Table of Craziness' (source
    text, line 1). It's possible to continue the existing one, if you just
    want to add more rows, by writing 'Table of Craziness (continued)' here.
