Problem__ PM_LPNeedsReal
  >--> In the sentence '1 tonne (singular) specifies a weight scaled up by
    1000.56' (source text, line 5), it looks as if you intend to give a real
    number as a scale factor for values of a weight. However, as you've defined
    it here, a weight uses only whole numbers, so this wouldn't work. You can
    probably fix this by making the example amount a real number too - say,
    writing '1.0 rel specifies...' instead of '1 rel specifies...'.
