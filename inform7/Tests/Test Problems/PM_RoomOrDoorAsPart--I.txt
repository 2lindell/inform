Problem__ PM_RoomOrDoorAsPart
  >--> The Big Door was set up as being part of something else, which doors and
    rooms are not allowed to be, because they are part of the fixed map of the
    world - if they were parts of something else, they might move around. (Of
    course, it's easy to make a door look as if it's part of something to the
    player - describing it as part of a wall, or bulkhead, or cottage, say -
    and if there really is an entrance that needs to move around - say, the
    hatchway on a tank - it's probably best to make it an enterable container.)
