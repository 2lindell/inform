Problem__ PM_EquationSymbolVague
  >--> In 'let F be given by Equation 2 where m is a number, a = 2' (source
    text, line 8), you define an equation which mentions the symbol 'm': but
    when an equation is named for use in a 'let' phrase, any variables listed
    under 'where...' have to be given definite values, not just vaguely said to
    have particular kinds. Otherwise, I can't do any calculation with them.
Problem__ PM_EquationSymbolMissing
  >--> In 'let F be given by Equation 2 where m is a number, a = 2' (source
    text, line 8), you asked to let F be given by the equation 'F = ma', but I
    can't see what to use for 'm'. The usual idea is to set the other variables
    in the equation using 'let': so adding 'let m be ...' before trying to find
    'F' should work.
