  >--> The sentence 'The badger is a text' (source text, line 1) reads to me as
    if 'badger' refers to something I should create as brand new - a text. But
    that can't be right, because this is a kind of value where I can't simply
    invent new values. (Just as the numbers are ..., 1, 2, 3, ... and I can't
    invent a new one called 'Susan'.) Perhaps you wanted not to invent a
    constant but to make a variable - that is, to give a name for a value which
    will change during play. If so, try something like 'The bonus is a number
    which varies'. Or perhaps you wanted to create a name as an alias for a
    constant value. If so, try something like 'The lucky number is always 8.'
    But this only makes a new name for the existing number 8, it doesn't invent
    a new number.
