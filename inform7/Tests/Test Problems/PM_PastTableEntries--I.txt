Problem__ PM_PastTableEntries
  >--> You wrote 'if the jewel entry was 12' (source text, line 10): but it's
    not safe to look up table entries in a way referring to past history,
    because it leads to dangerous ambiguities. For instance, does 'taking an
    item listed in the Table of Treasure for the first time' mean that this is
    the first time taking any of the things in the table, or only the first
    time this one? And so on.
