  >--> The painting is scenery, which means that it cannot sensibly have any
    'initial appearance' property - being scenery, it isn't announced when the
    player first sees it. That means the quoted text about it has to be read as
    its 'description' instead, seen when the player examines it. But the source
    text writes out its description, too, which means we have a subtle little
    contradiction here.
