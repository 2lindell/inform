Problem__ PM_NamedGeneric
  >--> I can't allow 'double-saying' (source text, line 3), because the phrase
    it gives a name to is generic, that is, it has a kind which is too vague.
    That means there isn't any single phrase which 'double-saying' could refer
    to - there would have to be different versions for every setting where it
    might be needed, and we can't predict in advance which one 'double-saying'
    might need to be.
