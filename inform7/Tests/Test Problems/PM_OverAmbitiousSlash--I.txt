Problem__ PM_OverAmbitiousSlash
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "bibble sculpture/[number]" as taking' (source
    text, line 3): but the slash '/' can only be used between single literal
    words, so 'underneath/under/beneath' is allowed but 'beneath/[florid ways
    to say under]/under' isn't.
Problem__ PM_GrammarMismatchesAction
  >--> The grammar you give in 'Understand "bibble sculpture/[number]" as
    taking' (source text, line 3) is not compatible with the Taking action
    (defined as 'applying to one thing') - the thing you suggest this action
    should act on is not an object at all.
Inform 7 has finished.
