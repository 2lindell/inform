Problem__ PM_MisalignedOtherwise
  >--> You wrote 'otherwise' (source text, line 6): but this doesn't match a
    corresponding 'if', as it must. An 'otherwise' must be vertically
    underneath the 'if' to which it corresponds, at the same indentation, and
    if the 'otherwise' uses a colon to begin a block then the 'if' must do the
    same.
