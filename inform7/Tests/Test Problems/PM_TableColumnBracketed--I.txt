Problem__ PM_TableColumnBracketed
  >--> In 'Table of Splodge' (source text, line 3), the column name '(rule)' (source
    text, line 4) cannot be used, because it is in brackets. (Perhaps you
    intended to use the brackets to give the kind of the entries, but forgot to
    put a name before the opening bracket.)
Problem__ PM_TableRowFull
  >--> In row 1 of the table 'Table of Splodge' (source text, line 3), the
    entry 'the evil rule' (source text, line 5) won't fit, because its row is
    already full. (This entry would be in column 2 and the table has only 1.)
