Problem__ PM_ExtMisidentifiedEnds
  >--> The extension Extmisidentifiedends Extension by Araminta Intest, which
    your source text makes use of, seems to be malformed: its 'begins here'
    sentence correctly identifies it, but then the 'ends here' sentence calls
    it 'Soggy Dishcloths' instead. (They need to be a matching pair except that
    the end does not name the author: for instance, 'Hocus Pocus by Jan
    Ackerman begins here.' would match with 'Hocus Pocus ends here.')
