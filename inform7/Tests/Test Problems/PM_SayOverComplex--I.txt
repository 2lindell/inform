Problem__ PM_SayOverComplex
  >--> You wrote 'say "[first time][first time][first tim [...]
    ly][only][only][only][only][only]."' (source text, line 3): but this is too
    complex a text substitution, and needs to be simplified. You might find it
    helpful to define a new text substitution of your own ('To say fiddly
    details: ...') and then use it in this text by including the '[fiddly
    details]'.
