  >--> In the sentence 'if "fish" relates 1 to 2' (source text, line 4), it
    looks as if you intend '"fish" relates 1 to 2' to be a condition, but that
    asks whether something relates something, and in Inform 'to relate' means
    that a particular relation applies between two things. Here, though, we
    have a text rather than the name of a relation.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if ("fish" relates 1 to 2 - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    "fish" relates 1 to 2 = a condition
