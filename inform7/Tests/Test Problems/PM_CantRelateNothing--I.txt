  >--> You wrote 'It requires nothing' (source text, line 6): but the
    relationship you describe seems to be with nothing, which does not really
    make sense. 'Nothing' looks like a noun, but really Inform uses it to mean
    the absence of one, so it's against the rules to say something like 'Mr
    Cogito disputes nothing' to try to put 'Mr Cogito' and 'nothing' into a
    relationship.
