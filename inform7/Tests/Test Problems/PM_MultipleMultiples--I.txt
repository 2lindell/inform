  >--> You wrote 'Understand "put [things] in [things]" as inserting it into' (source
    text, line 4): but there can be at most one token in any line which can
    match multiple things, so you'll have to remove one of the 'things' tokens
    and make it a 'something' instead.
Inform 7 has finished.
