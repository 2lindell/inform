Problem__ PM_RelationContradiction2
  >--> I'm finding a contradiction at the sentence 'Every man likes a color' (source
    text, line 8), because it means I can't set up the liking relation (between
    a thing and a color). On the one hand, Jack's color should relate to a
    nameless woman, but on the other hand to Jack, and this is a relation which
    doesn't allow such clashes.
