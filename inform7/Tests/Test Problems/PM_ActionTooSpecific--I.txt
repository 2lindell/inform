  >--> You wrote 'try examining the player in the NI School for Typing' (source
    text, line 4), but 'examining the player in the NI School for Typing'
    imposes too many restrictions on the action to be carried out, by saying
    something about the circumstances which you can't guarantee will be true.
    Sometimes this problem appears because I've misread text like 'in ...' as
    a clause saying that the action takes place in a particular room, when in
    fact it was part of the name of one of the items involved. If that's the
    problem, try using 'let' to create a simpler name for it, and then rewrite
    the 'try' to use that simpler name - the ambiguity should then vanish.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      try (examining the player in the ni school for typing - action) 
    I recognised:
    examining the player in the ni school for typing = a described action
