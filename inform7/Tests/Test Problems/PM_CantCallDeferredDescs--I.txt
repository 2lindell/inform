  >--> You wrote 'After printing the name of something while considering a
    thing (called X)' (source text, line 4): but 'called' can't be used when
    testing a description, since it would make a name for something which
    existed only so temporarily that it couldn't be used anywhere else.

  >--> In the sentence 'Showme X' (source text, line 6), I was expecting to
    read a value, but instead found some text that I couldn't understand - 'X'.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      showme (x - value) 
    But I didn't recognise 'x'.
