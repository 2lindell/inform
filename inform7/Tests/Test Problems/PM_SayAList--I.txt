  >--> You wrote 'say "[The noun] is a [clarity of the no [...] of scents which
    perfume the noun]."' (source text, line 35), and in particular 'a list of
    scents which perfume the noun': but this asked to say 'a list of...', which
    I read as being a general description applying to some lists and not
    others, so it's not something which can be said. (Maybe you meant 'the list
    of...' instead? That normally makes a definite list of whatever matches the
    '...' part.)
