Problem__ PM_CantAssertAdjective
  >--> In the sentence 'Depot is adjacent' (source text, line 5), you ask me to
    arrange for something to be 'adjacent' at the start of play. There are some
    adjectives ('open' or 'dark', for instance) which I can fix, but others are
    just too vague. For example, saying 'Peter is visible.' isn't allowed,
    because it doesn't tell me where Peter is. Like 'visible', being 'adjacent'
    is something I can test during play at any time, but not something I can
    arrange at the start.

  >--> In the sentence 'Laboratory is not green' (source text, line 7), you ask
    me to arrange for something not to be 'green' at the start of play. This is
    only possible when an adjective talks about an either/or property, like
    'open'/'closed' - if there are three or more possibilities then it's
    ambiguous. Even if there are only two possibilities, I can't always fix
    them just on your request - 'visible'/'invisible', for instance, is
    something I can test during play at any time, but not something I can
    arrange at the start.
