  >--> Column 2 (rank) of 'Table 1 - Admirals' (source text, line 3) contains
    no values and doesn't tell me anything about its kind, which means that I
    don't know how to deal with it. You should either put a value into the
    column somewhere, or else write the kind in as part of the heading: 'rank
    (a number)', say.
