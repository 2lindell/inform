Problem__ PM_GrammarValueRelation
  >--> The grammar you give in 'Understand "box of [something related by
    slyness]" as a box' (source text, line 7) contains a token which relates
    things to values - something related by slyness. At present, this is not
    allowed: only relations between kinds of object can be used in 'Understand'
    tokens.
Inform 7 has finished.
