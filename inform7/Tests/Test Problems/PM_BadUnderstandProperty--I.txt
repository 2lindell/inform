Problem__ PM_BadUnderstandProperty
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the transparent property as leading to blatant
    impropriety' (source text, line 3): but 'understand the ... property as
    ...' is only allowed if followed by 'describing ...' or 'referring to ...',
    so for instance 'understand the transparent property as describing a
    container.'
Inform 7 has finished.
