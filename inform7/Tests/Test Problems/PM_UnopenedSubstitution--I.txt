Problem__ PM_UnopenedSubstitution
  >--> You wrote 'say "foo the player] bar"' (source text, line 5): but the
    text here uses a close square bracket ']', which closes a substitution in
    the text, but never actually opened it, with a matching '['. (If you just
    wanted a literal close square bracket, use '[close bracket]'.)
