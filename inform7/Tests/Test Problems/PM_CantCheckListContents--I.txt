  >--> In 'floozle barbaz' (source text, line 8), you use a list which might or
    might not match a definition requiring a list of people. But there's no
    efficient way to tell during play whether the list actually contains that,
    without laboriously checking every entry. Because in general this would be
    a bad idea, this usage is not allowed.
