Problem__ PM_ThisIsEitherOr
  >--> You wrote 'A book can be mint or foxed (this is the cover state)' (source
    text, line 5): but a name can only be supplied using '... (this is...)'
    when a new property is being made with three or more named alternatives,
    whereas here a simpler either/or property is being made with just one or
    two possibilities - which means these named outcomes are the property names
    themselves. For instance, 'A book can be mint or foxed' makes two either/or
    properties, one called 'mint', the other called 'foxed'. So 'A book can be
    mint or foxed (this is the cover state)' is not allowed.
