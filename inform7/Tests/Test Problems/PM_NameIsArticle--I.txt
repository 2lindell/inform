Problem__ PM_NameIsArticle
  >--> You wrote 'A is a room' (source text, line 1): but this seems to give
    something a name which consists only of an article, that is, 'a', 'an',
    'the' or 'some'. This is not allowed since the potential for confusion is
    too high. (If you need, say, a room which the player sees as just 'A', you
    can get this effect with: 'A-Room is a room with printed name "A".')
