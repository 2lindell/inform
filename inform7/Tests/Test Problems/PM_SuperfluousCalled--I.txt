Problem__ PM_SuperfluousCalled
  >--> You wrote 'Movie has a theme called theme' (source text, line 5): but
    'called' should be used only when the name is different from the kind, so
    this sentence should be simplified. For example, 'A door has a colour
    called colour' should be written more simply as 'A door has a colour'; but
    'called' can be used for something like 'A door has a number called the
    street number'.
Inform 7 has finished.
