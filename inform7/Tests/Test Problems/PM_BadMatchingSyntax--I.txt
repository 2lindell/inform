  >--> You wrote 'The taking action has a number called the parenthetical
    amount (so there)' (source text, line 3), which I am reading as a request
    to make a new named variable for an action - a value associated with a
    action and which has a name. The request seems to say in parentheses that
    the name in question is 'parenthetical amount (so there)', but I only
    recognise the form '(matched as "some text")' here.
