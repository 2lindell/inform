  >--> You wrote 'Printing the name has a number called Fred' (source text, line 3):
    but an activity has to be formally referred to in a way making clear that
    it is indeed a rulebook when we give it named values, to reduce the risk of
    ambiguity. So 'The printing the banner text activity has a number called
    the accumulated vanity' is fine, but 'Printing the banner text has a number
    called...' is not. (I'm insisting on the presence of the word 'activity'
    because the syntax is so close to that for giving properties to objects,
    and it's important to avoid mistakes here.)
