  >--> You wrote 'Instead of dropping the CD or inserting the CD into the jewel
    box' (source text, line 5), which seems to introduce a rule, but the
    circumstances ('dropping the CD or inserting the CD into the jewel box')
    seem to be too general for me to understand in a single rule. I can
    understand a choice of actions, in a list such as 'taking or dropping the
    ball', but there can only be one set of noun(s) supplied. So 'taking the
    ball or taking the bat' is disallowed. You can get around this by using
    named actions ('Taking the ball is being mischievous. Taking the bat is
    being mischievous. Instead of being mischievous...'), or it may be less
    bother just to write more than one rule.

  >--> You wrote 'Instead of inserting the CD into the jewel box or looking' (source
    text, line 11), which seems to introduce a rule taking effect only
    'inserting the CD into the jewel box or looking'. But this is a combination
    of actions which cannot be mixed. The only alternatives where 'or' is
    allowed are cases where a choice of actions is given but applying to the
    same objects in each case. (So 'taking or dropping the CD' is allowed, but
    'dropping the CD or inserting the CD into the jewel box' is not, because
    the alternatives there would make different use of objects from each
    other.)
