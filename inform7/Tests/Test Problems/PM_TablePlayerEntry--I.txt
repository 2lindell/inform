Problem__ PM_TablePlayerEntry
  >--> In 'Table 1 - Admirals' (source text, line 3), the entry 'player' (source
    text, line 5) in column 1 (admiral) of row 1 is the name of a value which
    varies, not a constant, and can't be stored as a table entry. This
    variable is usually set to the constant value 'yourself', so you might want
    to write that instead.
Problem__ PM_TableKindlessColumn
  >--> Column 1 (admiral) of 'Table 1 - Admirals' (source text, line 3)
    contains no values and doesn't tell me anything about its kind.
