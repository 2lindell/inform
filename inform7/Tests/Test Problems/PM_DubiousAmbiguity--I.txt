Problem__ PM_DubiousAmbiguity
  >--> The phrase 'showme table of dup1' (source text, line 5) is ambiguous in
    a way that I can't sort out. I can see 2 different meanings of 'table of
    dup1', and no good way to choose.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      showme (table of dup1 - value) 
    I recognised:
    table of dup1 = a table name
