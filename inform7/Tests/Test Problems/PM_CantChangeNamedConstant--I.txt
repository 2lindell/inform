Problem__ PM_CantChangeNamedConstant
  >--> You wrote 'now red is blue' (source text, line 6): but I can't change
    that, because it is a name for a constant value. Some named values, like
    'the score', can be changed, because they were defined as values that vary.
    But others are fixed. If we write 'The oak tree can be sturdy,
    lightning-struck or leaning.', for instance, then 'sturdy' is a name for a
    value which is fixed, just as the number '7' is fixed.
