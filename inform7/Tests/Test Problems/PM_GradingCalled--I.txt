Problem__ PM_GradingCalled
  >--> You gave as a definition 'a thing (called the dome) is stately if its
    carrying capacity is 19 or more' (source text, line 3): but callings are
    not allowed when defining grading adjectives, so 'Definition: a container
    is large if its carrying capacity is 10 or more.' is fine, but so
    'Definition: a container (called the bag) is large if its carrying capacity
    is 10 or more.' is not - then again, there's very little call for it.
