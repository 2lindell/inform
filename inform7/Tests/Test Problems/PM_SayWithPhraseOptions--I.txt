Problem__ PM_SayWithPhraseOptions
  >--> You wrote 'To say wombling free, over hill and/or under dale' (source
    text, line 3): but phrase options are not allowed for 'say' phrases,
    because the commas would lead to ambiguous sentences, and because the
    content of a substitution is intended to be something conceptually simple
    and not needing clarification.
