  >--> You wrote 'The moon was a planetesimal' (source text, line 1): but
    assertions about the initial state of play must be given in the present
    tense, so 'The cat is in the basket' is fine but not 'The cat has been in
    the basket'. Time is presumed to start only when the game begins, so there
    is no anterior state which we can speak of.

  >--> You wrote 'Triton had been a Kuiper Belt Object' (source text, line 3):
    again, assertions about the initial state of play must be given in the
    present tense.
