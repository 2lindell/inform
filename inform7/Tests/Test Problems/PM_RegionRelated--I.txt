  >--> You wrote 'East of Eden is a region' (source text, line 1): but a region
    cannot be given a specific location, since it contains what may be many
    rooms, which may not be contiguous and could be scattered about all over.
    (Sometimes this problem arises because an ambiguous sentence like 'East of
    Eden is a region.' has been used: Inform reads that as saying that a
    nameless region lies to the east of the room 'Eden'. The desired effect can
    be got using 'called' to stop Inform taking 'East of' literally: for
    instance, 'The Land of Nod is in a region called East of Eden.'

  >--> You wrote 'On the Prairie is a region' (source text, line 1): again, a
    region cannot be given a specific location.

  >--> The sentence 'Small Room is a room in East of Eden' (source text, line 5)
    appears to say two things are the same - I am reading 'Small Room' and
    'room in East of Eden' as two different things, and therefore it makes no
    sense to say that one is the other: it would be like saying that 'the hawk
    is the handsaw'. It would be all right if the second thing were the name of
    a kind, perhaps with properties: for instance 'Elsinore is a lighted room'
    says that something called Elsinore exists and that it is a 'room', which
    is a kind I know about, combined with a property called 'lighted' which I
    also know about.
