  >--> The sentence 'Combat hit is an outcome' (source text, line 8) reads to
    me as if 'Combat hit' refers to something I should create as brand new - an
    outcome. That looks reasonable, since this is a kind which does have named
    values, but it's not allowed because this is a kind which is defined by the
    rows of a table ('Table of Outcomes' (source text, line 3)), not in
    isolated sentences like this one.
