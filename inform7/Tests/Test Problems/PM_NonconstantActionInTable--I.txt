  >--> In 'Table of Test Actions' (source text, line 9), I'm reading the text
    'Steve examining the moron' (source text, line 13) in column 1 (Commands)
    of row 3, but this is an action involving a variable, that is, a value that
    might vary in play. This often happens if the action mentions 'the
    player', for example, because 'the player' is a variable. If 'the player'
    is the person carrying out the action, simply leave those words out; if
    'the player' is involved in some other way, try using 'yourself' instead.
