  >--> In 'let Q be given by Equation 1 where t = 12s' (source text, line 16),
    you asked to let Q be given by the equation 'Q = It', but I can't see what
    to use for 'I'. The usual idea is to set the other variables in the
    equation using 'let': so adding 'let I be ...' before trying to find 'Q'
    should work.
