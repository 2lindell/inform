Problem__ PM_PlaceWithMissingRule
  >--> In 'The bar rule is listed after the foo rule in the every turn
    rulebook' (source text, line 7), you talk about the position of the rule
    'foo rule' in the rulebook 'Every turn', but in fact that rule isn't in
    this rulebook, so the placing instruction makes no sense.
