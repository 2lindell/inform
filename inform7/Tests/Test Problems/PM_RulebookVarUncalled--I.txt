Problem__ PM_RulebookVarUncalled
  >--> You wrote 'The every turn rulebook has an object' (source text, line 2),
    which I am reading as a request to make a new named variable for an
    rulebook - a value associated with a action and which has a name. But since
    you only give a kind, not a name, I'm stuck. ('The every turn rulebook has
    a number called importance' is right, 'The every turn rulebook has a
    number' is too vague.)
