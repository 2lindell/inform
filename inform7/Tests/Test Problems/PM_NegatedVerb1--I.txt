  >--> You wrote 'The Solomon Islands does not have an air force' (source text, line 1):
    but assertions about the initial state of play must be positive, not
    negative, so 'The cat is an animal' is fine but not 'The cat is not a
    container'. I have only very feeble powers of deduction - sometimes the
    implications of a negative statement are obvious to a human reader, but not
    to me.
