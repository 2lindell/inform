  >--> You wrote 'Transmission relates one remote to one trigger (called the
    target)' (source text, line 7): but with a one-to-one relation which is not
    symmetrical only the left-hand item can be given a name using 'called', so
    this needs rephrasing to name the left in terms of the right rather than
    vice versa. For instance, 'Transmission relates one remote to one gadget
    (called the target).' should be rephrased as 'Transmission relates one
    gadget (called the target) to one remote.' It will then be possible to talk
    about 'the gadget of' any given remote.
