  >--> You wrote 'The Home dwelling translates into I6 as "sweet"' (source text, line 3):
    but that isn't one of the things which can be translated to I6, and should
    be '... variable', '... property', '... object', '... kind', '... rule', or
    '... action'. For instance, 'The yourself object translates into I6 as
