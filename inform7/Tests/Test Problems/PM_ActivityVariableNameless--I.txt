Problem__ PM_ActivityVariableNameless
  >--> You wrote 'The Sinning activity has a vice' (source text, line 4), which
    I am reading as a request to make a new named variable for an activity - a
    value associated with a activity and which has a name. Here, though, there
    seems to be no name for the variable as such, only an indication of its
    kind. Try something like 'The printing the banner text activity has a
    number called the accumulated vanity'.
