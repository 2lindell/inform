Problem__ PM_WrongEndToPhrase
  >--> The line 'yes' (source text, line 4) seems to be a way that the phrase
    you're defining can come to an end, with a phrase to make a decision, but
    it should always end up with a phrase to decide a room.
Problem__ PM_WrongEndToPhrase
  >--> The line 'yes' (source text, line 7) seems to be a way that the phrase
    you're defining can come to an end, with a phrase to make a decision, but
    it should always end up with no value resulting.
Problem__ PM_RedundantReturnKOV
  >--> You wrote 'decide on 12' (source text, line 8) as the outcome of a
    phrase, a number, but in the definition of something which was not a phrase
    to decide a value.
Problem__ PM_WrongEndToPhrase
  >--> The line 'continue the action' (source text, line 11) seems to be a way
    that the phrase you're defining can come to an end, with no value
    resulting, but it should always end up with a phrase to make a decision.
Problem__ PM_ReturnWrongKind
  >--> You wrote 'decide on 1' (source text, line 12) as the outcome of a
    phrase to decide a value, but this was the wrong kind of value: a number
    rather than a truth state.
