  >--> You wrote 'More than three people are in the Dining Room' (source text, line 1):
    but complicated determiners are not allowed in assertions, so for instance
    'More than three people are in the Dining Room' or 'None of the containers
    is open' will be rejected. Only simple numbers will be allowed, as in
    examples like 'Three people are in the Dining Room.'

    complicated determiners are not allowed in assertions.
