  >--> You wrote 'arfle barfle gloop' (source text, line 4): but this is a
    phrase which I don't recognise, possibly because it is one you meant to
    define but never got round to, or because the wording is wrong (see the
    Phrasebook section of the Index to check). Alternatively, it may be that
    the text immediately previous to this was a definition whose ending,
    normally a full stop, is missing?
