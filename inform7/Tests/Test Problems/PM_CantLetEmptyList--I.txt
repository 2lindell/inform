Problem__ PM_CantLetEmptyList
  >--> The phrase 'let Y be {}' (source text, line 4) tries to use 'let' to
    give a temporary name to the empty list '{ }', but because it's empty, I
    can't tell what kind of value the list should have. Try 'let X be a list of
    numbers' (or whatever) instead.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      let (y - a new name) be ({ } - value) 
    I recognised:
    { } = a list of nothing
    The name 'y' doesn't yet exist.
Inform 7 has finished.
