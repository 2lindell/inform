  >--> In 'Table of Testing One' (source text, line 3), you've written the
    heading of the column 'subject (woman)' (source text, line 4) to say that
    each entry should be a woman. But a column with the same name also appears
    in 'Table of Testing Two' (source text, line 7), and each entry there is a
    text. Inform doesn't allow this - the same column name always has to have
    the same kind of entry, whichever tables it appears in.
