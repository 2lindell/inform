Problem__ PM_ActionVarUncalled
  >--> You wrote 'The removing it from action has an object' (source text, line 2),
    which I am reading as a request to make a new named variable for an action
    - a value associated with a action and which has a name. But since you only
    give a kind, not a name, I'm stuck. ('The taking action has a number called
    tenacity' is right, 'The taking action has a number' is too vague.)
