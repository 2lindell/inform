Problem__ PM_UnderstandPropertyAsNonObjectKind
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the transparent property as referring to blue' (source
    text, line 5): but a property can be understood as referring to a single
    object (or a kind of object) but not to something of any other kind, and
    this refers to something which is not an object.
Problem__ PM_UnderstandPropertyAsNonObjectKind
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the transparent property as referring to a colour'
    (source text, line 7): again, a property can be understood as referring to
    a single object (or a kind of object) but not to something of any other
    kind.
