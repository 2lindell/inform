  >--> You wrote 'It is lighted' (source text, line 1): but I'm not sure what
    to make of the pronoun here, since it is unclear what previously mentioned
    thing is being referred to. In general, it's best only to use 'it' where
    it's unambiguous, and it may be worth noting that 'they' is not allowed to
    stand for more than one object at a time.
