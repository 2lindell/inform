  >--> You wrote 'Marriage relates one man (called the husband) to one woman
    (called the wife)' (source text, line 3): but the terms of the relation
    can't be named on both sides at once, and because of that it's best to use
    a single even-handed name: for instance, 'Marriage relates one person to
    another (called the spouse).' rather than 'Employment relates one person
    (called the boss) to one person (called the underling).'
