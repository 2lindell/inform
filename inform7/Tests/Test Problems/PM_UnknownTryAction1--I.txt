  >--> You wrote 'try taking 22' (source text, line 4), but 'taking 22' is not
    an action I can try. This looks as if it might be because it contains
    something of the wrong kind. My best try involved seeing if '22' could be
    an object, which might have made sense, but it turned out to be a number.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      try (taking 22 - action) 
    But I didn't recognise 'taking 22'.
