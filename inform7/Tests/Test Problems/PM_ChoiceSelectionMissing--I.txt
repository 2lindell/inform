Problem__ PM_ChoiceSelectionMissing
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> The dialogue choice offered by '-- (if 1 is 1)' (source text, line 7)
    doesn't say what the option actually is, which is allowed only if it is a
    simple '--' used as a divider. Here, it seems to have some bracketed
    annotations as well. That must be wrong.
Inform 7 has finished.
