Problem__ PM_ValueCantHaveVProperties
  >--> You wrote 'A number has a number called square root' (source text, line 1):
    but this is a kind of value which is not allowed to have properties of its
    own, because this would be impossible to store in any sensible way. For
    instance, 'A scene has a number called difficulty.' is fine because there
    are not many scenes and I know them all, but 'A number has a text called
    French translation.' is not allowed, because storing something for every
    possible number takes an impossible amount of space. (See the Kinds index
    for which kinds can have properties.)
