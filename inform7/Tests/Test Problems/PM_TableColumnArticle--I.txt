Problem__ PM_TableColumnArticle
  >--> In 'Table of Despair' (source text, line 1), the column name 'a' (source
    text, line 2) cannot be used, because there would be too much ambiguity
    arising from its ordinary meaning as an article. (It would be quite awkward
    talking about the 'a entry', for example.)
Problem__ PM_TableWithoutRows
  >--> 'Table of Despair' (source text, line 1) has no rows.
