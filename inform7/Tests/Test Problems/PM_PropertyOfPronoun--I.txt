Problem__ PM_PropertyOfPronoun
  >--> You wrote 'It can be pointing down' (source text, line 4): but it's
    often a little ambiguous to declare properties for 'it' (or some similarly
    vague pronoun like 'him' or 'her'), so it seems best to spell this out by
    saying exactly what the property's owner or owners would be.
Inform 7 has finished.
