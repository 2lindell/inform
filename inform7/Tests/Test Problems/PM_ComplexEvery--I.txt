  >--> You wrote 'A coin is in every open container' (source text, line 1): but
    in an assertion 'every' or 'all' can only be used with a kind, so for
    instance 'A coin is in every container' is all right, because 'container'
    is a kind, but not 'A coin is in every open container', because 'open
    container' is now a kind qualified by a property which may come or go
    during play. (This problem sometimes happens because a thing has been
    called something like an 'all in one survival kit' - if you need that sort
    of name, try using 'called' to set it.)
