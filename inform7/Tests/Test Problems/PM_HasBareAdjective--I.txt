  >--> In 'It has fuzzy' (source text, line 5) you write about the fuzzy
    property as if it were some kind of value or possession, but fuzzy is an
    either/or property - something is either fuzzy or not. (For example, it's
    incorrect to say 'The glass box has transparent'; the right way is just
    'The glass box is transparent.')
