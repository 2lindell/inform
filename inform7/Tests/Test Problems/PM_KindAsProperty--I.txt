Problem__ PM_KindAsProperty
  >--> You wrote ''A splurge is a kind of thing' (source text, line 3)', but
    that seems to say that a property ('splurge' (source text, line 5)) has to
    be a kind as well. It is sometimes okay for a property to have the same
    name as a kind, but only when that kind is what it stores, and there
    shouldn't be a sentence like this one to declare the kind - it will be made
    when the property is made, and doesn't need to be made again.
