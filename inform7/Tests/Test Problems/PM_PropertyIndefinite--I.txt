Problem__ PM_PropertyIndefinite
  >--> In the sentence 'A thing has a relation of values to values called bar' (source
    text, line 3), I am unable to create the property 'bar', because it has too
    vague a kind ('a relation of values'). I need to know exactly what kind of
    value goes into each property: for instance, it's not enough to say 'A door
    has a list of values called the access list', because I don't know what the
    entries in this list would have to be - 'A door has a list of people called
    the access list' would be better.
