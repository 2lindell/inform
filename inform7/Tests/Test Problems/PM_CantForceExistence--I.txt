  >--> You wrote 'now a woman is in the Wharf' (source text, line 4): but this
    is not explicit enough, and should set out definite relationships between
    specific things, like 'now the cat is in the bag', not something more
    elusive like 'now the cat is carried by a woman.' (Which woman? That's the
    trouble.)
