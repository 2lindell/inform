Problem__ PM_ChoiceOtherwiseUnexpected
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote '-- otherwise' (source text, line 7): but this run of choices
    uses 'otherwise' unexpectedly, since 'otherwise' can only be used as the
    last option, and only where the options are written in terms of actions.

    choices uses 'otherwise' unexpectedly.
