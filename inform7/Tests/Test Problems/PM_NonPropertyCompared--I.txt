  >--> In the sentence 'if the Typographium is blue' (source text, line 5), it
    looks as if you intend 'Typographium is blue' to be a condition, but taken
    literally that says that an object is the same as a value. Maybe you

    - say - 'A thing has a colour.')

      if (typographium is blue - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    typographium is blue = a condition
