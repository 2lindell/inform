Problem__ PM_TableIncompatibleEntry2
  >--> In 'Table of Testing One' (source text, line 3), column 1 (subject), the
    entry 'yourself' (source text, line 5) (row 1) has the wrong kind to be in
    the 'subject' column - it's an object, whereas I think every entry ought to
    be a text. The entries under a given column name must be blanks or values
    of the same kind as each other, and this applies even to columns in
    different tables if they have the same name. Compare the table 'Table of
    Testing Two' (source text, line 8), where there's also a column called
    'subject'.
