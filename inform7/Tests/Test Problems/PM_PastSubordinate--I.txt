Problem__ PM_PastSubordinate
  >--> You wrote 'if the player is someone female who was in the Home' (source
    text, line 4): but subordinate clauses have to be in the present tense, so
    'the Black Door was open' is fine, but not 'something which was open'. Only
    the main verb can be in the past tense.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (player is someone female who was in the home - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    player is someone female who was in the home = a condition
