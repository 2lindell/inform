  >--> You wrote 'A twentynine is a kind of 29' (source text, line 1): but I
    don't recognise that as a kind, such as 'room' or 'door': it would need to
    be straightforwardly the name of a kind, and not be qualified with
    adjectives like 'open'.

  >--> You wrote 'A gentian is a kind of flower' (source text, line 3): again,
    I don't recognise that as a kind.
