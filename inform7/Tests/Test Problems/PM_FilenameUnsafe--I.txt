  >--> You wrote 'The File of Glaciers is called "ice, Kodiak bears and other
    hazards.txt"' (source text, line 3): but filenames must be very
    conservatively chosen, in order to be viable on a wide range of computers.
    They must consist of 3 to 23 English letters or digits, with the first
    being a letter. Spaces are not allowed, and nor are periods. (A file
    extension, such as '.glkdata', may be added on some platforms
    automatically: this is invisible to Inform.)
