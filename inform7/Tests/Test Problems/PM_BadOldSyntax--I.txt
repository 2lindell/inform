  >--> The rule or phrase definition 'When play begins' (source text, line 3)
    seems to use indentation and colons to group phrases together into 'if',
    'repeat' or 'while' blocks. That's fine, but then this phrase seems to be
    missing some punctuation - '-- 0 say "Okay."' (source text, line 6).
    Perhaps a colon is missing?
