  >--> You wrote 'The fierynesses are unburnt, cinders, flames, burning,
    scorching, searing, frying, igniting, inferno, subsiding, flickering, and
    burnt' (source text, line 3): unfortunately 'burning' (source text, line 4)
    is already the name of an action, and it would only confuse things if we
    used it for a value as well.
