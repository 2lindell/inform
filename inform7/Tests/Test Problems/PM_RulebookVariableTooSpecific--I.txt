Problem__ PM_RulebookVariableTooSpecific
  >--> You wrote 'The every turn rulebook has an open door called Trevor' (source
    text, line 3), which I am reading as a request to make a new named variable
    for a rulebook - a value associated with a rulebook and which has a name.
    The request seems to say that the value in question is 'open door', but
    this is too specific a description. (Instead, a kind of value (such as
    'number') or a kind of object (such as 'room' or 'thing') should be given.
    To get a property whose contents can be any kind of object, use 'object'.)
