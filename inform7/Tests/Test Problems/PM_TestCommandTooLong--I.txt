Problem__ PM_TestCommandTooLong
  >--> You wrote 'Test me with "i/z/take inventory/take inventory/ [...]
    tory/take inventory/take inventory"' (source text, line 3): but this test
    script contains a command which is too long, and cannot be fed into Inform
    for automatic testing. (The format for a test script is a sequence of
    commands, divided up by slashes '/': maybe you forgot these divisions?)
Inform 7 has finished: 17 centiseconds used.
