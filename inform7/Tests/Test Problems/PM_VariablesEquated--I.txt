  >--> The sentence 'The stored actions variable is a truth state that varies' (source
    text, line 3) seems to tell me that 'stored actions variable', which
    describes a kind of variable, is the same as 'truth state that varies',
    another description of a kind of variable - but that doesn't make sense to
    me. (Perhaps you intended one of these to be a specific variable, but chose
    a wording which looked accidentally like a general description?)
