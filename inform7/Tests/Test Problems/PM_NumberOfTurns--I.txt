Problem__ PM_NumberOfTurns
  >--> In the sentence 'let T be the number of turns' (source text, line 4), I
    was expecting to read a description of values, but instead found some text
    that I couldn't understand - 'turns'. Perhaps by 'turns' you meant the
    number of turns of play to date? If so, try 'turn count' instead.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      number of (turns - description of values) 
    But I didn't recognise 'turns'.
