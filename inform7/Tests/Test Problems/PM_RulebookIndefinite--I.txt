  >--> You wrote 'Zog is a sayable value based rulebook' (source text, line 2):
    but this is a rulebook for values of a kind which isn't definite, and
    doesn't tell me enough about what sort of value the rulebook should work
    on. For example, 'The mystery rules are a number based rulebook' is fine
    because 'number' is definite, but 'The mystery rules are a value based
    rulebook' is too vague.
