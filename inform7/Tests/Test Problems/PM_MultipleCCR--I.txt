  >--> You wrote 'Check taking or dropping' (source text, line 3), but the
    situation this refers to ('taking or dropping') is not a single action.
    Rules in the form of 'check', 'carry out' and 'report' are tied to specific
    actions, and must give a single explicit action name - even if they then go
    on to very complicated conditions about any nouns also involved. So 'Check
    taking something: ...' is fine, but not 'Check taking or dropping
    something: ...' or 'Check doing something: ...' - the former names two
    actions, the latter none.
