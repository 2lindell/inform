  >--> The rule or phrase definition 'When play begins' (source text, line 3)
    seems to use both ways of grouping phrases together into 'if', 'repeat' and
    'while' blocks at once. Inform allows two alternative forms, but they
    cannot be mixed in the same definition. One way is to end the 'if',
    'repeat' or 'while' phrases with a 'begin', and then to match that with an
    'end if' or similar. ('Otherwise' or 'otherwise if' clauses are phrases
    like any other, and end with semicolons in this case.) You use this
    begin/end form here, for instance - 'if 1 is 2 begin' (source text, line 4).
    The other way is to end with a colon ':' and then indent the subsequent
    phrases underneath, using tabs. (Note that any 'otherwise' or 'otherwise
    if' clauses also have to end with colons in this case.) You use this
    indented form here - 'while 1 is 2' (source text, line 7).
