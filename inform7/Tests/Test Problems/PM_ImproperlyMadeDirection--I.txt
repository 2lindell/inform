Problem__ PM_ImproperlyMadeDirection
  >--> You wrote 'Gook is a direction' (source text, line 6): but directions
    must be created by only the simplest possible sentences, in the form
    'North-north-west is a direction' only. Using adjectives, 'called',
    'which', and so on is not allowed. (In practice this is not too much of a
    restriction. I won't allow 'Clockwise is a privately-named direction.', but
    I will allow 'Clockwise is a direction. Clockwise is privately-named.')
