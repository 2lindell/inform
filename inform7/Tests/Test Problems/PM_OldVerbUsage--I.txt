Problem__ PM_OldVerbUsage
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the verb "wibble" as "push"' (source text, line 3):
    but this is an outdated form of words, and Inform now prefers 'Understand
    the command ...' rather than 'Understand the verb ...'. (Since this change
    was made in beta-testing, quite a few old source texts still use the old
    form: the authors of Inform apologise for any nuisance incurred.)
Inform 7 has finished.
