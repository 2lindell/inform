Problem__ PM_AmbiguousPerformanceStyle
  >--> The sentence 'Spoken after somebody else is a performance style' (source
    text, line 5) creates a performance style which would have to be used by
    marking a line as '(after somebody else)', but that already has a meaning
    as a line annotation, so this would be ambiguous. Call it something else?
