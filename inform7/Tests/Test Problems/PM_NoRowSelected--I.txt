Problem__ PM_NoRowSelected
  >--> You wrote '"[flavour entry]"' (source text, line 9): but no row seems to
    have been chosen at this point, so it doesn't make sense to talk about the
    entries within it. (By 'at this point', I mean the point when the table
    will have to be looked at. This might be at another time altogether if we
    are storing away instructions for later in a text substitution, e.g.,
    writing 'now the description of the player is "Thoroughly [vanity
    entry].";' - remember that the substitution is acted on when the text is
    printed, which could be at any time, and no row will be chosen then.)
