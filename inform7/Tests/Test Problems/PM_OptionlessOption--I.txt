  >--> In the sentence 'if using the American dialect' (source text, line 8), I
    was expecting to read a use option, but instead found some text that I
    couldn't understand - 'American dialect'. The names of use options, on the
    rare occasions when they appear as values, always end with the word
    'option' - for instance, we have to write 'American dialect option' not
    'American dialect'. As your text here doesn't end with the word 'option',
    perhaps you've forgotten this arcane rule?
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      using (american dialect - use option) 
    But I didn't recognise 'american dialect'.
