Problem__ PM_BadConstantListEntry
  >--> The constant list 'father-of relation, asdfadfaf' (source text, line 10)
    contains an entry 'asdfadfaf' which isn't any form of constant I'm able to
    read.Note that lists have to be written with spaces after commas, so I
    like '{2, 4}' but not '{2,4}', for instance.
