    A2 that is A3 that is A4 that is A5 that is A6 that is A7 that is A8' (source
    text, line 12): but this complicated condition makes use of too many
    temporary values, and will have to be simplified.

  >--> You wrote 'if every room encloses a thing that is A0 that is A1 that is
    A2 that is A3 that is A4 that is A5 that is A6 that is A7 that is A8' (source
    text, line 12): but there are too many temporarily-named values in this
    phrase, which may be a sign that it is complicated enough to need breaking
    up into smaller phrases making use of each other. The limit is 15 at a time
    for a Z-machine project (see the Settings) and 256 at a time for Glulx.
    That has to include both values created in the declaration of a phrase
    (e.g. the 'N' in 'To deduct (N - a number) points: ...', or the 'watcher'
    in 'Instead of taking something in the presence of a man (called the
    watcher): ...'), and also values created with 'let' or 'repeat' (each
    'repeat' loop claiming two such values) - not to mention one or two values
    occasionally needed to work with Tables. Because of all this, it's best to
    keep the complexity to a minimum within any single phrase.
