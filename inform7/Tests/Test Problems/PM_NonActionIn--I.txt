  >--> You wrote 'Every turn in the Burrow' (source text, line 3), but 'in...'
    used in this way should really belong to an action: for instance, 'Before
    waiting in the Library'. Rules like 'Every turn in the Library' don't work,
    because 'every turn' is not an action; what's wanted is 'Every turn when in
    the Library'.
