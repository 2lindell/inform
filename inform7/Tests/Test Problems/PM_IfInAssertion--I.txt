Problem__ PM_IfInAssertion
  >--> I am reading the sentence 'If the box is open then award 4 points' (source
    text, line 1) as a declaration of the initial state of the world, so I'm
    expecting that it will be definite. The only way I can construe it that way
    is by thinking that 'If the box' and 'open then award 4 points' are two
    different things, but that doesn't make sense, and the 'if' makes me think
    that perhaps you did not mean this as a definite statement after all.
    Although 'if...' is often used in rules and definitions of what to do in
    given circumstances, it shouldn't be used in a direct assertion.
