  >--> You wrote 'The verb to imagine (he imagines, they imagine) implies the
    whole shooting match' (source text, line 1): but I don't see what the
    meaning of this verb ought to be, because it doesn't take any of the three
    forms I know: a relation name ('...means the wearing relation'), a property
    name ('...means the matching key property'), or another verb ('...means to
    wear.').
