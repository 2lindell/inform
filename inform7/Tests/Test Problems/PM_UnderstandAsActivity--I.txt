Problem__ PM_UnderstandAsActivity
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "think about [noun]" as thinking about' (source
    text, line 4): but this 'understand ... as ...' gives text meaning an
    activity, rather than an action. Since activities happen when Inform
    decides they need to happen, not in response to typed commands, this
    doesn't make sense.
Inform 7 has finished.
