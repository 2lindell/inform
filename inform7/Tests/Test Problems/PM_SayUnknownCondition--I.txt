Problem__ PM_SayUnknownCondition
  >--> In the line '"A [tree condition] tree"' (source text, line 3), I was
    expecting that 'tree condition' would be something to 'say', but it didn't
    look like any form of 'say' that I know. So I tried to read 'tree
    condition' as a value of some kind (because it's legal to say values), but
    couldn't make sense of it that way either. Sometimes this happens because
    punctuation has gone wrong - for instance, if you've omitted a semicolon or
    full stop at the end of the 'say' phrase.Names which end in 'condition'
    often represent the current state of something which can be in any one of
    three or more states. This will only be the case if you have explicitly
    said so, with a line like 'The rocket is either dry, fuelled or launched.'
    - in which case the value 'rocket condition' will always be one of 'dry',
    'fuelled' or 'launched'. Note that all of this only applies to a list of
    three or more possibilities - a thing can have any number of either/or
    properties. For instance, a container is open or closed, but it also
    transparent or opaque. Neither of these counts as its 'condition'.
