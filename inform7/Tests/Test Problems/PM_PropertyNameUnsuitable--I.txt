  >--> The sentence 'The Tree can be climbed "There is a tree in the middle of
    the northern area."' (source text, line 4) seems to create a new property
    called 'climbed "There is a tree in the middle of the northern area."', but
    this is not a good name, and I think I must have misread what you wanted.
    Maybe the punctuation is wrong?
