  >--> You wrote 'The Gazebo is usually lighted' (source text, line 3): but you
    can only equivocate with 'usually', 'rarely', 'always' and the like when
    talking about kinds of thing, because when a specific thing is involved you
    should say definitely one way or another. 'A cave is usually dark' is fine,
    but not 'the Mystic Wood is usually dark'.
