Problem__ PM_RulebookVariableVague
  >--> You wrote 'The every turn rulebook has a value called Trevor' (source
    text, line 3), but saying that a variable is something as vague as this
    does not give me a clear enough idea what it will hold. You need to say
    what kind of value: for instance, 'A door has a number called street
    address.' is allowed because 'number' is specific about the kind of value.
Inform 7 has finished.
