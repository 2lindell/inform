  >--> You wrote 'try arfle barfle gloop' (source text, line 4): but this is
    not an action I recognise, or else is malformed in a way I can't see how to
    sort out.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      try (arfle barfle gloop - action) 
    But I didn't recognise 'arfle barfle gloop'.
