Problem__ PM_RulebookVariableAnd
  >--> You wrote 'The every turn rulebook has a number called Trevor and a text
    called wibbly wobbly' (source text, line 3), which I am reading as a
    request to make a new named variable for a rulebook - a value associated
    with a rulebook and which has a name. The request seems to say that the
    name in question is 'Trevor and a text called wibbly wobbly', but I'd
    prefer to avoid punctuation marks, 'and', 'or', 'with', or 'having' in such
    names, please.
Inform 7 has finished.
