  >--> You wrote 'Sound of rustling leaves is the file 100' (source text, line 3):
    but a sound effect can only be declared as a quoted file name, which should
    be the name of an AIFF or OGG file inside the Sounds subfolder of the
    project's .materials folder. For instance, 'Sound of Swordplay is the file
    "Crossed Swords.aiff".'
