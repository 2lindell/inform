Problem__ PM_BeforeTheLibrary
  >--> You wrote 'Include (- Global whatever = 1; -) before the library' (source
    text, line 3): but this syntax was withdrawn in January 2008, but the
    effect you want can probably be achieved by just deleting the words 'before
    the library.'
Inform 7 has finished.
