  >--> You wrote 'if an empty text is a flavour listed in the Table of Exempla'
    (source text, line 9): but I am not able to look up table entries in this
    complicated condition, which seems to involve making a potentially large
    number of checks in rather few words (and may perhaps result from a
    misunderstanding such as writing the name of a kind where an individual
    object is intended?).
