  >--> The phrase a room encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a
    room that encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that
    encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a
    room that encloses a room is too complicated for me to disentangle without
    running very, very slowly as I check many ambiguities in it. There ought to
    be some way to simplify things for me?
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (a room encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that
    encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a
    room that encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that
    encloses a room - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    a room encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that
    encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a
    room that encloses a room that encloses a room that encloses a room that
    encloses a room = a condition
