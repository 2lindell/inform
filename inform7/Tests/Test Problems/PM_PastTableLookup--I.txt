Problem__ PM_PastTableLookup
  >--> You wrote 'Report taking an item listed in the Table of Point Values for
    the first time' (source text, line 7): but it's not safe to look up table
    entries in a way referring to past history, because it leads to dangerous
    ambiguities. For instance, does 'taking an item listed in the Table of
    Treasure for the first time' mean that this is the first time taking any of
    the things in the table, or only the first time this one? And so on.
