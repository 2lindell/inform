Problem__ PM_UnderstandActionPattern
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "stand" as getting off a room' (source text, line 2):
    but this meaning looks like a form of action, but needs to be written more
    simply, just as the action itself and without any details about what is
    acted on. For example, 'Understand ... as examining' is fine, but
    'Understand ... as examining a door' is not. (What will be examined depends
    on what is in the actual command this 'Understand' instruction will try to
    work on - we cannot know yet whether it will be a door.)
Inform 7 has finished.
