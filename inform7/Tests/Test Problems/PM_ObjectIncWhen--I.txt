  >--> The sentence 'Jumping when the actor is on the trampoline is
    high-jumping' (source text, line 5) seems to be talking about a previously
    unknown room or thing called Jumping when the actor. Ordinarily, I would
    create this, but because the name contains the word 'when' or 'while' I'm
    going to say no. That's because this far more often happens by mistake
    than deliberately. For instance, people sometimes type lines like 'Jumping
    when the actor is on the trampoline is high-jumping.' But in fact although
    'jumping' is an action, 'Jumping when...' is not - 'when' can't be used
    here (though it can be used in rule preambles). So the sentence is instead
    read as making an object 'jumping when the actor' and putting it on top of
    another one, 'trampoline is high-jumping'. This can lead to a lot of
    confusion. If you genuinely do want an object whose name contains the word
    'when', try something like: 'In the box is a thing called When worlds
    collide.'
