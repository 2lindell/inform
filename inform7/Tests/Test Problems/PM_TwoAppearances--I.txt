  >--> You wrote '"The Arena is the centre of the Roman world."' (source text, line 3),
    but in another sentence '"The Arena, a steam-yacht of 45 feet, is anchored
    here."' (source text, line 5): Arena seems to have two different
    descriptions, perhaps because you intended the second description to apply
    to something mentioned in between, but declared it in such a way that it
    was never the subject of an assertion. For instance, 'The Forest Clearing
    is northeast of the Woods.' makes the Forest Clearing the current room
    being discussed, but 'Northeast of the Woods is the Forest Clearing.'
    leaves the room under discussion unchanged, because the Forest Clearing is
    not the subject of the sentence.
