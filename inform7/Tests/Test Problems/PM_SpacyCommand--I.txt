  >--> You wrote 'Understand the command "two words" as something new' (source
    text, line 3): but 'understand the command ... as ...' is only allowed when
    the old command is a single word, so for instance 'understand the command
    "capture" as "get"' is okay, but 'understand the command "capture the flag"
    as "get"' is not.
Inform 7 has finished.
