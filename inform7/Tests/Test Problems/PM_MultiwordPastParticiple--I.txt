Problem__ PM_MultiwordPastParticiple
  >--> You wrote 'Hanging around until is an action with past participle hung
    around until, applying to one time' (source text, line 3): but a past
    participle must be given as a single word, even if the action name itself
    is longer than that. (For instance, the action name 'hanging around until'
    should have past participle given just as 'hung'; I can already deduce the
    rest.)
