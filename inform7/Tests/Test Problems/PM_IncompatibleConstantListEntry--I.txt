Problem__ PM_IncompatibleConstantListEntry
  >--> The constant list '"fish", 21' (source text, line 13) contains an entry
    '21' whose kind is 'a number', but that's not compatible with the kind I
    had established from looking at earlier entries ('a text').
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      let (l - a new name) be ({ "fish" , 21 } - value) 
    I recognised:
    { "fish" , 21 } = a list of nothing
    The name 'l' doesn't yet exist.
Inform 7 has finished.
