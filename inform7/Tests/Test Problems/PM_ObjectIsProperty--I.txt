Problem__ PM_ObjectIsProperty
  >--> You wrote 'The Palace is the description' (source text, line 3): but
    that seems to say that some object is a property, like saying 'The brick
    building is the description': if you want to specify the description of the
    current object, try putting the sentence the other way around ('The
    description is...').
