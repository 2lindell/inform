  >--> In the sentence 'The description is the printed name' (source text, line 1),
    it looks as if you intend 'The description is the printed name' to be
    asserting something, but that seems to say that two different properties
    are the same - like saying 'The indefinite article is the printed name':
    that might be true for some things, some of the time, but it makes no sense
    in a general statement like this one.
