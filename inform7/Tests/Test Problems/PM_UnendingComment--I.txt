    This probably means that a ']' is missing somewhere. (If you are using
    Inform with syntax colouring, look for where the comment colour starts.)
    Inform's convention on 'nested comments' is that each '[' in a comment must
    be matched by a corresponding ']': so for instance '[This [even nested like
    so] acts as a comment]' is a single comment - the first ']' character
    matches the second '[' and so doesn't end the comment: only the second ']'
    ends the comment.
