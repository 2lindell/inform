Problem__ PM_BareKindVariable
  >--> The sentence 'if M is K' (source text, line 4) seems to use a kind
    variable by its letter alone in the context of a noun, which Inform doesn't
    allow. It's fine to say 'if the noun is a K', for example, but not 'if K is
    number'. By putting 'a' or 'an' in front of the kind variable, you make
    clear that I'm supposed to perform matching against a description.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (m is k - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    m is k = a condition
