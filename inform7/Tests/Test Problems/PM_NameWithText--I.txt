Problem__ PM_NameWithText
  >--> You wrote 'The grey "magic" footstool is a supporter in the Formless
    Void' (source text, line 3): but this seems to give something a name which
    contains double-quoted text, which is not allowed. If you do need quotes in
    a name, one option would be to write something like 'In the Saloon is
    'Black' Jacques Bernoulli.'; but this problem message is often caused by an
    accident in punctuation, in which case you never intended to create an
    object - you thought that the text ended a sentence because it finished
    with sentence-ending punctuation, when in fact it didn't, so that I read
    the next words as following on.
