  >--> You wrote 'The carrying capacity of 10 is 5' (source text, line 3): but
    this tries to set a property for a value which can't have properties, and
    that isn't allowed. For instance, 'The description of the Great Portal is
    "It's open."' would be fine, if Great Portal were a room, but 'The
    description of 6 is "Sixish."' would not, because the number 6 isn't
    allowed to have properties.
