  >--> You wrote 'When the play begins' (source text, line 3): but there's no
    scene called 'the play', so I think you need to remove 'the' - Inform has
    two special rulebooks, 'When play begins' and 'When play ends', and I think
    you probably mean to refer to one of those.
Problem__ PM_WhenThePlay
  >--> You wrote 'When the play ends' (source text, line 5): again, there's no
    scene called 'the play'.
