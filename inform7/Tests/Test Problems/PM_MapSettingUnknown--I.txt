  >--> You gave as a hint in map-making: 'cyberman-population of the Taj Mahal
    set to 28' (source text, line 3). The parameter has to be one of the fixed
    named set given in the documentation, like 'room-name'. All parameters are
    one word, but many are hyphenated. (Also, note that 'colour' has the
    Canadian/English spelling, not the American one 'color'.)
