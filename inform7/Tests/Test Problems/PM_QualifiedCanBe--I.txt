  >--> You wrote 'A portable thing can be stashable or unstashable or variably
    stashable' (source text, line 3): but only a room, a thing or a kind can
    have such adjectives applied to it, and qualifications cannot be used. It
    makes no sense to say 'An open door can be rickety or sturdy' because the
    door still has to have the property even at times when it is not open: we
    must instead just say 'A door can be rickety or sturdy'.
