  >--> You wrote 'if the noun was in the Wharf' (source text, line 4): but it
    is misleading to talk about the noun, the second noun or the person asked
    to do something in past tenses, because in the past, those were different
    things and people, or may have been nothing at all. Writing 'if the noun
    has been unlocked' tends not to do what we might hope because the value of
    'noun' changes every turn. So such conditions are not allowed, although to
    get around this we can instead write 'if we have unlocked the noun', which
    uses a special mechanism to remember everything which has happened to every
    object.
