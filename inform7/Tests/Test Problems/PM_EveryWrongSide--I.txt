  >--> You wrote 'Sir Francis prefers every blonde' (source text, line 15): but
    'every' can only be used on the other side of the verb, because of
    limitations in Inform (but also to avoid certain possible ambiguities). In
    general, 'every' should be applied to the subject of an assertion sentence
    and not the object. Thus 'Sir Francis prefers every blonde' is not allowed,
    but 'Every blonde is preferred by Sir Francis' is. (It would be different
    if, instead of Sir Francis who's just one man, the name of a kind appeared:
    'A vehicle is in every room' is fine, for example, because 'vehicle' is a
    kind.)
