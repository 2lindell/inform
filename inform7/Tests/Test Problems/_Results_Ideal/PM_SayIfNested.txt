  >--> You wrote '"Typewriters and stuff. [if Clark i [...] e]At least Clark
    has gone![end if]"' (source text, line 5): but a second '[if ...]' text
    substitution occurs inside an existing one, which makes this text too
    complicated. While a single text can contain more than one '[if ...]', this
    can only happen if the old if is finished with an '[end if]' or the new one
    is written '[otherwise if]'. If you need more complicated variety than this
    allows, the best approach is to define a new text substitution of your own
    ('To say fiddly details: ...') and then use it in this text by including
    the '[fiddly details]'.
