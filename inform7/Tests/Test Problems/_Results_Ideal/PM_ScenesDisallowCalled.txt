Problem__ PM_ScenesDisallowCalled
  >--> You wrote 'Train Stop begins when a person (called the passenger) is in
    Eynforme Halt' (source text, line 3): but '(called ...)' is not allowed
    within conditions for a scene to begin or end, since calling gives only a
    temporary name to something, for the purpose of further instructions which
    immediately follow in. Here there is no room for such further instructions,
    so a calling would have no effect. Anyway - not allowed!
