Problem__ PM_IncludeInsteadOf
  >--> You wrote 'Include (- [ SquareRoot num; "Nobody cares about square
    roots, son."; ]; -) instead of "Mathematics.i6t"' (source text, line 3):
    but this syntax was withdrawn in April 2022, in favour of a more finely
    controlled inclusion command. See the manual, but you can probably get what
    you want using 'replacing "SomeFunctionName".' rather than 'instead of
    ...'.
Inform 7 has finished.
