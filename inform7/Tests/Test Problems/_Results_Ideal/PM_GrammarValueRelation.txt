Problem__ PM_GrammarValueRelation
  >--> The grammar you give in 'Understand "box of [something related by
    slyness]" as a box' (source text, line 7) contains a token which relates
    things to values - 'something related by slyness' (source text, line 1). At
    present, this is not allowed: only relations between kinds of object can be
    used in 'Understand' tokens.
