Problem__ PM_SayComma
  >--> In the line 'say, "Hello."' (source text, line 4), I was expecting that
    ', "Hello."' would be something to 'say', but unexpectedly it began with a
    comma. The usual form is just 'say "text"', perhaps with some substitutions
    in square brackets within the quoted text, but no commas.
