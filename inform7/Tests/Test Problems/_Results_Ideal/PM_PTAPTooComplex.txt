  >--> You wrote 'Every turn when we have taken a utensil' (source text, line 7):
    but that is too complex a past tense action, at least for this version of
    Inform to handle: we may improve matters in later releases. The restriction
    is that the actions used in the past tense may take at most one object, and
    that this must be a physical thing (not a value, in other words). And no
    details of where or what else was then happening can be specified.
