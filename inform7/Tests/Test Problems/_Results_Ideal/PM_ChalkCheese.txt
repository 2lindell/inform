  >--> The sentence 'The fish is the fowl' (source text, line 1) appears to say
    two things are the same - I am reading 'fish' and 'fowl' as two different
    things, and therefore it makes no sense to say that one is the other: it
    would be like saying that 'the hawk is the handsaw'. It would be all right
    if the second thing were the name of a kind, perhaps with properties: for
    instance 'Elsinore is a lighted room' says that something called Elsinore
    exists and that it is a 'room', which is a kind I know about, combined with
    a property called 'lighted' which I also know about.
