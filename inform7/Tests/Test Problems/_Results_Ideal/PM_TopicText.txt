Problem__ PM_TopicText
  >--> In 'Table of Inventory' (source text, line 3), the column name 'topic'
    is not allowed to have a clarifying kind in brackets after it. Just say
    'topic' and leave it at that.
Problem__ PM_TableRowFull
  >--> In row 1 of the table 'Table of Inventory' (source text, line 3), the
    entry '"x"' (source text, line 5) won't fit, because its row is already
    full. (This entry would be in column 1 and the table has only 0.)
Inform 7 has finished.
