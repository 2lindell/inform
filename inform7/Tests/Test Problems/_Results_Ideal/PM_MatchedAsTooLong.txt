  >--> You wrote 'The asking it about action has an object called the active
    node (matched as "located near")' (source text, line 1), which I am reading
    as a request to make a new named variable for an action - a value
    associated with a action and which has a name. You say that it should be
    '(matched as "located near")', but I can only recognise such matches when a
    single keyword is used to introduce the clause, and this is more than one
    word.
