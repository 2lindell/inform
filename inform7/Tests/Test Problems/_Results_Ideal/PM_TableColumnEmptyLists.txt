Problem__ PM_TableColumnEmptyLists
  >--> In 'Table of Requirements' (source text, line 3), the column
    'ingredients' (source text, line 4) seems to consist only of empty lists.
    This means that I can't tell what kind of value it should hold - are they
    to be lists of numbers, for instance, or lists of texts, or some other
    possibility? Either one of the entries must contain a non-empty list - so
    that I can deduce the answer by looking at what is in it - or else the
    column heading must say, e.g., by calling it 'exceptions (list of texts)'
    with the kind of value in brackets after the name.
