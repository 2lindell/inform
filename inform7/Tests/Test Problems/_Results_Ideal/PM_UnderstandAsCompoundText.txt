Problem__ PM_UnderstandAsCompoundText
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "burn [something]" as "burn [something preferably
    held]"' (source text, line 3): but if 'understand ... as ...' gives the
    meaning as text then it must describe a single new token, so that
    'Understand "group four/five/six" as "[department]"' is legal (defining a
    new token "[department]", or adding to its definition if it already
    existed) but 'Understand "take [thing]" as "drop [thing]"' is not allowed,
    and would not make sense, because "drop [thing]" is a combination of two
    existing tokens - not a single new one.
Inform 7 has finished.
