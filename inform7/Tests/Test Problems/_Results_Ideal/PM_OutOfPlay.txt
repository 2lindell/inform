Problem__ PM_OutOfPlay
  >--> In the sentence 'if the player is out of play' (source text, line 4), I
    was expecting to read a condition, but instead found some text that I
    couldn't understand - 'player is out of play'. People sometimes say that
    things or people removed from all rooms are 'out of play', but Inform uses
    the adjective 'off-stage' - for instance, 'if the ball is off-stage'. If
    you would like 'out of play' to work, you could always write 'Definition: A
    thing is out of play if it is off-stage.' Then the two would be equivalent.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (player is out of play - a condition): 
    But I didn't recognise 'player is out of play'.
