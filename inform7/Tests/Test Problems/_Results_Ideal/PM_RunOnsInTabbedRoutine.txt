  >--> The phrase or rule definition 'When play begins' (source text, line 3)
    is written using the 'colon and indentation' syntax for its 'if's,
    'repeat's and 'while's, but that's only allowed if each phrase in the
    definition occurs on its own line. So phrases like 'say "IO"' (source text, line 5),
    which follow directly on from the previous phrase, aren't allowed.
