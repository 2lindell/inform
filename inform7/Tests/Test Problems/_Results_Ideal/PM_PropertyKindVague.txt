  >--> You wrote 'A room has a value called Price' (source text, line 1), but
    saying that a property is a 'value' does not give me a clear enough idea
    what it will hold. You need to say what kind of value: for instance, 'A
    door has a number called street address.' is allowed because 'number' is
    specific about the kind of value.
