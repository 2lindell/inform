Problem__ PM_KindAsActualValue
  >--> You wrote ''A persuasion is a kind of value' (source text, line 3)', but
    that seems to say that a value already in existence ('persuasion' (source
    text, line 3)) has to be a kind as well. (It's a rulebook.)
Problem__ PM_ObjectAndValueEquated
  >--> The sentence 'The persuasion rules are convinced, leaning, and
    unconvinced' (source text, line 5) seems to say that 'persuasion rules',
    which I think is a rulebook, and 'convinced', which I think is an object,
    are the same. That can't be right, so I must have misunderstood. Perhaps
    you intended to make something new, but it accidentally had the same name
    as something already existing?
