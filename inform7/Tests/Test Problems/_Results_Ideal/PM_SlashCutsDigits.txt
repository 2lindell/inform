Problem__ PM_SlashCutsDigits
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "new/-- br80/08/-- camera" as the camera' (source
    text, line 5): but 'understand' uses a slash '/' here in a way which cuts
    off something which contains only digits, and this will not do anything
    good. (Note that a slash in grammar like this means an alternative choice
    of word.)
Problem__ PM_UnderstandEmptyText
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "new/-- br80/08/-- camera" as the camera' (source
    text, line 5): but 'understand' should be followed by text which contains
    at least one word or square-bracketed token, so for instance 'understand
    "take [something]" as taking' is fine, but 'understand "" as the fog' is
    not. The same applies to the contents of 'topic' columns in tables, since
    those are also instructions for understanding.
Inform 7 has finished.
