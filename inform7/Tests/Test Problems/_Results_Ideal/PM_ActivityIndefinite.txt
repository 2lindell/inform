  >--> You wrote 'Enunciating something is an activity on values' (source text, line 3):
    but this is an activity on a kind which isn't definite, and doesn't tell me
    enough about what sort of value the activity should work on. For example,
    'Divining is an activity on numbers' is fine because 'numbers' is definite,
    but 'Divining is an activity on values' is not allowed.
