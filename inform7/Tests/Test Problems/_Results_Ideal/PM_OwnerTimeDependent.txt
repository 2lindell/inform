Problem__ PM_OwnerTimeDependent
  >--> You wrote 'A person that is not an animal can be talkative' (source text, line 3):
    but ownership of a property is something that has to be always true or
    always false, so that 'a room can be secret' is fine - a room is always a
    room - but 'a dark room can be secret' is not - a room might be dark some
    of the time, and lighted the rest of the time. You need to give a
    straightforward owner, and not qualify it with adjectives or other
    conditions.
Problem__ PM_OwnerTimeDependent
  >--> You wrote 'A room that is not dark can be semi-dark' (source text, line 5):
    again, ownership of a property is something that has to be always true or
    always false.
Problem__ PM_QualifiedCanBe
  >--> You wrote 'A room that is dark can be dangerous' (source text, line 6):
    but only a room, a thing or a kind can have such adjectives applied to it,
    and qualifications cannot be used. It makes no sense to say 'An open door
    can be rickety or sturdy' because the door still has to have the property
    even at times when it is not open: we must instead just say 'A door can be
    rickety or sturdy'.
