Problem__ PM_TableKindTwice
  >--> In 'Table of Whoops' (source text, line 5), column 1 (fruit), the entry
    'person' (source text, line 8) (row 2) is the name of a kind. This isn't a
    specific value. You're allowed to write in the name of a kind like this if
    the column starts out with blank entries - to tell me what might eventually
    go there - but only once; and this is the second time. (The first was
    'thing' (source text, line 7).)
