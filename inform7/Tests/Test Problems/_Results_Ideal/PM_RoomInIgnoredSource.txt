  >--> This is supposed to be a source text which only contains release
    instructions to bind up an existing story file (for instance, one produced
    using Inform 6). That's because the instruction 'Release along with an
    existing story file' is present. So the source text must not contain rooms
    or other game design - these would be ignored.
Inform 7 has finished.
