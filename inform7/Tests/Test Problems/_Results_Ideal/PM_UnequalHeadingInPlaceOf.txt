  >--> You wrote 'Chapter of Minimal Grammar (in place of Section SR4/10 -
    Grammar in Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 3): but
    these headings are not of the same level, so it is not possible to make the
    replacement. (Level here means being a Volume, Book, Part, Chapter or
    Section: for instance, only a Chapter heading can be used 'in place of' a
    Chapter.)
