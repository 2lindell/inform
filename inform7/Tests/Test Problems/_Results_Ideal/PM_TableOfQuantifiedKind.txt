  >--> You wrote 'Three berries on the bush are defined by the Table of Tasty
    Berries' (source text, line 5): but you can't use 'defined by' a table
    while also talking about the number of things to be defined, since that
    could too easily lead to contradictions. (So 'Six doors are defined by the
    Table of Portals' is not allowed - suppose there are ten rows in the Table,
    making ten doors?)
