  >--> You wrote 'The printed name of the Palace is the printed name of the
    Hills' (source text, line 3): but this seems to say two different
    properties are not simply equal but somehow the same thing, like saying
    that 'the printed name of the millpond is the printed name of the village
    pond'. This puts me in a quandary: which should be changed to match the
    other, and what if I am unable to work out the value of either one?
