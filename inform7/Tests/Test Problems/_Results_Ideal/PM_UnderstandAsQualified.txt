  >--> You wrote 'Understand "dome" as the lighted Xanadu' (source text, line 3):
    but I cannot understand text as meaning an object qualified by relative
    clauses or properties, only a specific thing, a specific value or a kind.
    (But the same effect can usually be achieved with a 'when' clause. For
    instance, although 'Understand "bad luck" as the broken mirror' is not
    allowed, 'Understand "bad luck" as the mirror when the mirror is broken'
    produces the desired effect.)
