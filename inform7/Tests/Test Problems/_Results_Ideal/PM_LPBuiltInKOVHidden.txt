  >--> You wrote '99-99-99 specifies a combination' (source text, line 2): but
    you can only specify ways to write new kinds of value, as created with
    sentences like 'A weight is a kind of value.', and not the built-in ones
    like 'number' or 'time'. (This one is a kind used behind the scenes by
    Inform, so it's reserved for Inform's own use, and you can't do much else
    with it.)
Inform 7 has finished: 27 centiseconds used.
