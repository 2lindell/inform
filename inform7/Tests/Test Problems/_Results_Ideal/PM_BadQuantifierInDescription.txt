Problem__ PM_BadQuantifierInDescription
  >--> In 'foo three rooms' (source text, line 8) you wrote the description
    'three rooms' in the context of a value, but descriptions used that way are
    not allowed to talk about quantities. For example, it's okay to write 'an
    even number' as a description value, but not 'three numbers' or 'most
    numbers'.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      foo (three rooms - description of rooms) 
    I recognised:
    three rooms = a description of rooms
