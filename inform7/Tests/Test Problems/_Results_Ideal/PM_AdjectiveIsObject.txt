  >--> You wrote 'Lighted is the Winter Palace' (source text, line 3): but that
    seems to say that an adjective is a noun, like saying 'Open are the doubled
    doors': which I'm picky about, preferring it written the other way about
    ('The doubled doors are open'). Less poetic, but clearer style.
