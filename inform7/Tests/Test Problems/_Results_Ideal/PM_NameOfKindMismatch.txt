Problem__ PM_NameOfKindMismatch
  >--> You wrote 'assay people' (source text, line 11), but although 'people'
    is the name of a kind, it isn't the name of a kind of an enumerated value,
    which this phrase needs.

      assay (people - name of kind) 
    I recognised:
    people = a description of people
