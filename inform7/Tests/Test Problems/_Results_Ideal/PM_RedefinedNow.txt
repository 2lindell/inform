  >--> You wrote 'To now the volume of fluid of (C - a fluid container) is (X -
    number)' (source text, line 6): but creating new variants on 'now' is not
    allowed, because 'now' plays a special role in the language. It has a
    wide-ranging ability to make a condition become immediately true. (To give
    it wider abilities, the idea is to create new relations.)
