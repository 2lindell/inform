  >--> You wrote 'In the tank is a fish called Wanda' (source text, line 1):
    but I can only make 'a something called whatever' when the something is a
    kind I know, possibly qualified with adjectives. For instance, 'an open
    door called the Marble Door' is fine because 'door' is the name of a kind
    and 'open' is an adjective which means something for doors. But 'a grand
    archway called the Great Gates' would not normally mean anything to me,
    because 'archway' is not one of the standard kinds in Inform. (Try
    consulting the Kinds index.)
