Problem__ PM_PluralIsQuoted
  >--> You wrote 'The plural of coin is "monies"' (source text, line 5): but
    declares a plural for a phrase using quoted text, which is forbidden.
    Sentences like this are supposed to declare plurals without quotation
    marks: for instance, 'The plural of procurator fiscal is procurators
    fiscal.'
