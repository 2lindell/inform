  >--> You wrote 'Include Extinadequatevm Extension by Araminta Intest' (source
    text, line 1): but my copy of Extinadequatevm Extension by Araminta Intest
    stipulates that it is 'for Glulx only'. That means it can only be used with
    certain of the possible compiled story file formats, and at the moment, we
    don't fit the requirements. (You can change the format used for this
    project on the Settings panel.)
