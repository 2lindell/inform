  >--> You wrote 'Include Extinadequatevm Extension by Araminta Intest' (source
    text, line 1): but my copy of Extinadequatevm Extension by Araminta Intest
    stipulates that it is '(For Glulx Only)'. That means it can only be used
    with certain of the possible compiled story file formats, and at the
    moment, we don't fit the requirements. (You can change the format used for
    this project on the Settings panel.)
Inform 7 has finished: 12 centiseconds used.
