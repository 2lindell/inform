  >--> You wrote 'The specification of 12 is "A dozen."' (source text, line 3):
    but this tries to set specification text for a particular value, rather
    than a kind of value. 'Specification' is a special property used only to
    annotate the Index, and it makes no sense to set this property for anything
    other than a kind of value, a kind of object or an action.
