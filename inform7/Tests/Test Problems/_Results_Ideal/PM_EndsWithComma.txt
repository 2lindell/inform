Problem__ PM_EndsWithComma
  >--> You wrote 'The chosen color is red,' (source text, line 5): but this
    seems to refer to something whose name ends with a comma, which is
    forbidden. Perhaps you used a comma in punctuating a sentence? Inform
    generally doesn't like this because it reserves commas for specific
    purposes such as dividing rules or 'if' phrases.
