  >--> In 'To flob (N - any number)' (source text, line 3), the text 'any
    number' after the hyphen should tell me what kind of value goes here (like
    'a number', or 'a vehicle'), but it has to be a single value, and not a
    description of what might be multiple values. So 'N - a number' is fine,
    but not 'N - three numbers' or 'N - every number'.
