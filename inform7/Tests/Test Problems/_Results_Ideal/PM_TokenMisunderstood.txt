  >--> You wrote 'To shoot (arfle barfle gloop) wombles' (source text, line 3):
    but the brackets '(' and ')' here neither say that something varies but has
    a given type, nor specify a called name, so I can't make sense of them. For
    a 'To...' phrase, brackets like this are used with a hyphen dividing the
    name for a varying value and the kind it has: for instance, 'To contribute
    (N - a number) dollars: ...'. Rules, on the other hand, use brackets to
    give names to things or rooms found when matching conditions: for instance,
    'Instead of opening a container in the presence of a man (called the
    box-watcher): ...'
