  >--> The grammar you give in 'Understand "blob [something which can see the
    player]" as examining' (source text, line 3) contains a token which is just
    too complicated - 'something which can see the player' (source text, line 1).
    For instance, a token using subordinate clauses - such as '[a person who
    can see the player]' will probably not be allowed.
