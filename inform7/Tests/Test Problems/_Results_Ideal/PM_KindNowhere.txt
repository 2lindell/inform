  >--> You wrote 'A number is nowhere' (source text, line 3), but the number
    seems to be said to be 'nowhere' in some way, which doesn't make sense. An
    individual thing can be 'nowhere', but here we're talking about a whole
    kind, and it's not allowed to talk about general locations of a whole kind
    of things at once.
