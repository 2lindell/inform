Problem__ PM_LocalInDescription
  >--> You wrote 'enumerate things in the location of the item' (source text, line 5),
    but descriptions used as values are not allowed to contain references to
    temporary values (defined by 'let', or by loops, or existing only in
    certain rulebooks or actions, say) - unfortunately 'item' is just such a
    temporary value. The problem is that it may well not exist any more when
    the description needs to be used, in another time and another place.
