  >--> I've made something called 'Wallace, Gromit Too' (source text, line 1)
    but it has a comma in its name, which is forbidden. Perhaps you used a
    comma in punctuating a sentence? Inform generally doesn't like this because
    it reserves commas for specific purposes such as dividing rules or 'if'
    phrases.
