  >--> You wrote 'Some ships are defined by Table 1' (source text, line 2), but
    this would mean making each of the names in the first column a ship that's
    new. That looks reasonable, since this is a kind which does have named
    values, but one of the restrictions on definitions-by-table is that all of
    the values of the kind have to be made by the table: you can't have some
    defined in ordinary sentences and others in the table.
