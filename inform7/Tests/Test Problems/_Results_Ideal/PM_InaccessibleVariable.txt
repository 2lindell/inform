Problem__ PM_InaccessibleVariable
  >--> The sentence 'Foo is usually 5' (source text, line 7) tells me that
    'Foo' has a specific initial value, but this is a variable which has been
    translated into an I6 'Global' called 'foobar' at the lowest level of
    Inform. Any initial value must be given in its I6 definition, not here.
