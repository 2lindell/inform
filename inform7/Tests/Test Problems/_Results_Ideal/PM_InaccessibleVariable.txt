Problem__ PM_InaccessibleVariable
  >--> The sentence 'Foo is usually 5' (source text, line 7) tells me that
    'Foo' has a specific initial value, but this is a variable which has been
    translated into an Inter variable defined in a kit. Any initial value must
    be given there, and not here.
Inform 7 has finished.
