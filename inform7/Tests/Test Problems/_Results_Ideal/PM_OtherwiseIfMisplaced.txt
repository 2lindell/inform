  >--> You wrote 'Else if true is true, say "--."' (source text, line 4): but
    the 'otherwise if' clause here seems not to be occurring inside a large
    'if', and seems to be freestanding instead. (Though 'otherwise ...' can
    usually be used after simple one-line 'if's to provide an alternative
    course of action, 'otherwise if...' is a different matter, and is used to
    divide up larger-scale instructions.)
