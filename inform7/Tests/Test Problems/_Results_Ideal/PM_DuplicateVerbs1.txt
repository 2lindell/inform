  >--> You wrote 'The verb to frob (he frobs, they frob, he frobbed, it is
    frobbed, he is frobbing) implies the mopping relation' (source text, line 13),
    but in another sentence 'The verb to frob (he frobs, they frob, he frobbed,
    it is frobbed, he is frobbing) implies the frobbing relation' (source text, line 5):
    but this gives us two definitions of what appears to be the same verb, or
    at least has the same infinitive form.

  >--> You wrote 'The verb to be means the enclosure relation' (source text, line 16),
    but in another sentence 'The verb to be means the equality relation' (Basic
    Inform, line 22): again, this gives us two definitions of what appears to
    be the same verb.
Inform 7 has finished.
