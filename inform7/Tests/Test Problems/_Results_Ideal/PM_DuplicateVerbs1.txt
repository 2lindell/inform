  >--> You wrote 'The verb to frob (he frobs, they frob, he frobbed, it is
    frobbed, he is frobbing) implies the mopping relation' (source text, line 13),
    but in another sentence 'The verb to frob (he frobs, they frob, he frobbed,
    it is frobbed, he is frobbing) implies the frobbing relation' (source text, line 5):
