Problem__ PM_LineNamedTwice
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote 'Marcellus (this is the first named line; this is the second
    named line): "What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?"' (source text, line 7):
    but this dialogue line seems to be named more than once, which is not
    allowed. It can be anonymous, but otherwise can only have one name.
Inform 7 has finished.
