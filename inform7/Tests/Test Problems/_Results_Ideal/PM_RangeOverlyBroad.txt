  >--> You wrote 'Globbing relates various people to various values' (source
    text, line 5): but relations aren't allowed to range over all 'objects' or
    all 'values', as these are too broad. A relation has to be between two
    kinds of object, or kinds of value. So 'Taming relates various people to
    various animals' is fine, because 'people' and 'animals' both mean kinds of
    object, but 'Wanting relates various objects to various values' is not
    allowed.

    text, line 7): again, relations aren't allowed to range over all 'objects'
    or all 'values'.
