  >--> You wrote 'Include (- ... -) before "The Riddle of the Sands" in
    "Relations.i6t"' (source text, line 3): but that template file didn't have
    a part with that name, so this attempt to intervene had no effect. Each
    template file is divided internally into a number of named parts, and you
    have to quote their names precisely. (Looking at the typeset form of the
    template, available at the Inform website, may help.)
