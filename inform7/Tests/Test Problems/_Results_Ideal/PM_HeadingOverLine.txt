I've now read your source text, which is 17 words long.

  >--> The text 'Chapter 1 On Certain Magnetic Phenomena Et Their Explanation
    In Terms Of The Divine Spirit Of Potatoes' (source text, line 1) seems to
    be a heading, but contains a line break, which is not allowed: so I am
    reading it as just 'Chapter 1 On Certain Magnetic Phenomena Et Their
    Explanation In Terms' (source text, line 1) and ignoring the continuation
    'Of The Divine Spirit Of Potatoes' (source text, line 2). The rule is that
    a heading must be a single line which is the only sentence in its
    paragraph, so there must be a skipped line above and below.
