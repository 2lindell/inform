  >--> You wrote 'A container never is usually opaque' (source text, line 3):
    but this sentence seems to have a likelihood qualification on both sides of
    the verb, which is not allowed. 'The black door certainly is usually open'
    might possibly be grammatical English in some idioms, but Inform doesn't
    like a sentence in this shape because the 'certainly' on one side of the
    verb and the 'usually' on the other are rival indications of certainty.
