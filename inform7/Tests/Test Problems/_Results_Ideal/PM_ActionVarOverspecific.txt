Problem__ PM_ActionVarOverspecific
  >--> You wrote 'The taking action has an open door called the portal' (source
    text, line 3), which I am reading as a request to make a new named variable
    for an action - a value associated with a action and which has a name. The
    request seems to say that the value in question is 'open door', but this is
    too specific a description. (Instead, a kind of value (such as 'number') or
    a kind of object (such as 'room' or 'thing') should be given. To get a
    property whose contents can be any kind of object, use 'object'.)
