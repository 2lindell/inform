  >--> You wrote 'If the score exceeds 10' (source text, line 1): but I can't
    find a verb that I know how to deal with. This looks like an 'if' phrase
    which has slipped its moorings, so I am ignoring it. ('If' phrases, like
    all other such instructions, belong inside definitions of rules or phrases
    - not as sentences which have no context. Maybe a full stop or a skipped
    line was accidentally used instead of semicolon, so that you inadvertently
    ended the last rule early?)
