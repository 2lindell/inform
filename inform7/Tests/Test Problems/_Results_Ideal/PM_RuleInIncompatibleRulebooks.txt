  >--> You've asked to put the rule 'foo rule' into the rulebook 'dramatic' (source
    text, line 9), which is based on a number and produces a time; but it was
    originally written to go into a rulebook of a different kind, 'carry out
    Dropping' (source text, line 1), which is based on an action name and
    produces nothing. Because those kinds are different, 'foo rule' can't go
    into 'dramatic' (source text, line 9).
