Problem__ PM_EmptyIndentedBlock
  >--> The phrase or rule definition 'When play begins' (source text, line 30)
    is written using the 'colon and indentation' syntax for its 'if's,
    'repeat's and 'while's, where blocks of phrases grouped together are
    indented one tab step inward from the 'if ...:' or similar phrase to which
    they belong. But the phrase 'if 5 is 5' (source text, line 56), which ought
    to begin a block, is immediately followed by 'say "Hi!"' (source text, line 57)
    at the same or a lower indentation, so the block seems to be empty - this
    must mean there has been a mistake in indenting the phrases.
Problem__ PM_TooMuchIndentation
  >--> The phrase or rule definition 'When play begins' (source text, line 30)
    is written using tab indentations to show how its phrases are to be grouped
    together. But the level of indentation goes far too deep, reaching more
    than 25 tab stops from the left margin.
