  >--> You wrote 'Trevor initially carries the fish' (source text, line 3): but
    you can only say 'initially' when creating variables using 'is', so 'The
    squirrel population is initially 0' is fine, but not 'The acorn is
    initially carried by Mr Hedges.' - probably you only need to remove the
    word 'initially'.
