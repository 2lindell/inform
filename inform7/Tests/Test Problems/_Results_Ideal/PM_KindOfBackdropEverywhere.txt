Problem__ PM_KindOfBackdropEverywhere
  >--> You wrote 'A backdrop is usually everywhere' (source text, line 3), but
    the backdrop seems to be said to be 'everywhere' in some way, which doesn't
    make sense. An individual backdrop can be 'everywhere', but here we're
    talking about a whole kind, and it's not allowed to talk about general
    locations of a whole kind of things at once.
