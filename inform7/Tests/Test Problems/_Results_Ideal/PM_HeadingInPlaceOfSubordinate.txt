In Part 1 - The Discussing Action:
  >--> In the sentence 'Section 1 - Greeting definitions (in place of Part Six
    - Grammar in Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 5), it
    looks as if you intend to replace a section of source text from the
    extension 'Standard Rules by Graham Nelson', but that doesn't really make
    sense because this new piece of source text is part of a superior heading
    (''Part 1 - The Discussing Action (in place of Part Six - Grammar in
    Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 3)') which is already
    being replaced spliced into 'Standard Rules by Graham Nelson'.
