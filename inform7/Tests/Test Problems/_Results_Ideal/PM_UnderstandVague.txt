  >--> You wrote 'Understand "look frog" as a number' (source text, line 3):
    but 'understand ... as ...' should be followed by a meaning, which might be
    an action (e.g., 'understand "take [something]" as taking'), a thing
    ('understand "stove" as the oven') or more generally a value ('understand
    "huitante" as 80'), or a named token for use in further grammar
    ('understand "near [something]" as "[location phrase]"'). Also, the meaning
    needs to be precise, so 'understand "x" as a number' is not allowed - it
    does not say which number.
