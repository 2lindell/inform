  >--> You wrote 'A room can be either elongated, round or octagonal' (source
    text, line 3): but that looks like an attempt to use 'either' other than to
    lay out exactly two possibilities, which is not allowed. (Technically it
    ought to be legal to have a property whose name actually starts with
    'either' but the confusion would be just too awful to contemplate.)
