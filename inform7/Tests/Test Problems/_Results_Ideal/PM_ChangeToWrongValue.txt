  >--> You wrote 'let the stanza be 123' (source text, line 5), but 'stanza' is
    supposed to be a stored value holding a room, so it cannot be set equal to
    123, whose kind is a number.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (stanza - a new name) be (123 - description of relations of
    values) 
    2.  let (stanza - a new name) be (123 - name of kind) 
    3.  let (stanza - a new name) be (123 - value) 
    4.  let (stanza - a temporary named value) be (123 - value) 
    I recognised:
    stanza = a temporary named value, holding a room
