Problem__ PM_APClauseIndefinite
  >--> You wrote 'Check counting value (called N)' (source text, line 6): but
    that action seems to involve a value which is unclear about its kind, and
    that's not allowed. For example, you're not allowed to just say 'Instead of
    taking a value: ...' because the taking action applies to objects; the
    vaguest you're allowed to be is 'Instead of taking an object: ...'.
Problem__ PM_Unknown
  >--> In the sentence 'showme N' (source text, line 7), I was expecting to
    read a value, but instead found some text that I couldn't understand - 'N'.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      showme (n - value) 
    But I didn't recognise 'n'.
Problem__ PM_SayUnknown
  >--> In the line 'say "Count [N]."' (source text, line 8), I was expecting
    that 'N' would be something to 'say', but it didn't look like any form of
    'say' that I know. So I tried to read 'N' as a value of some kind (because
    it's legal to say values), but couldn't make sense of it that way either.
    Sometimes this happens because punctuation has gone wrong - for instance,
    if you've omitted a semicolon or full stop at the end of the 'say' phrase.
