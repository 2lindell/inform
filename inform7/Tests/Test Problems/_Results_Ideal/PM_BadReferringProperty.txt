Problem__ PM_BadReferringProperty
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the banana rating property as describing a person'
    (source text, line 3): but that property is of a kind which I can't
    recognise in typed commands, so that it cannot be understand as describing
    or referring to something. I can understand either/or properties,
    properties with a limited list of named possible values, numbers, times of
    day, or units; but certain built-into-Inform kinds of value (like snippet
    or rulebook, for instance) I can't use.
Inform 7 has finished.
