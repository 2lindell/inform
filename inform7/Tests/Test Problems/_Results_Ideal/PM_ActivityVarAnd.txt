  >--> You wrote 'The printing the name activity has a number called cash and
    carry' (source text, line 3), which I am reading as a request to make a new
    named variable for an activity - a value associated with a activity and
    which has a name. The request seems to say that the name in question is
    'cash and carry', but I'd prefer to avoid 'and', 'or', 'with', or 'having'
    in such names, please.
