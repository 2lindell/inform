  >--> In the text at '"This is Boing, the leading pet sho [...] at random] in
    the Kidlington area."' (source text, line 1), the text substitution
    '[purely at random]' ought to occur as the ending part of its construction,
    but it appears to be on its own. (The construction I'm thinking of is
    '[one of] ... [or] ... [at random]/[purely at random]/[then at
    random]/[then purely at random]/[sticky random]/[as decreasingly likely
    outcomes]/[in random order]/[cycling]/[stopping]'.)
