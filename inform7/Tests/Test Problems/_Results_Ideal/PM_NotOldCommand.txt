Problem__ PM_NotOldCommand
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the command "flibble" as "woogie"' (source text, line 3):
    but 'understand the command ... as ...' should end with a command already
    defined, as in 'understand the command "steal" as "take"'. (This problem is
    sometimes seen when the wrong sort of Understand... sentence has been used:
    'Understand the command "steal" as "take".' tells me to treat the command
    STEAL as a synonym for TAKE when reading the player's commands, whereas
    'Understand "steal [something]" as taking.' tells me that here is a
    specific grammar for what can be said using the STEAL command.)
Inform 7 has finished.
