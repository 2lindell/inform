  >--> In 'Definition' (source text, line 3) you defined an adjective by 'An
    open door is wibbly if it is 100 years old' intending that it would apply
    to 'An open door': but this is slippery, because it can change during play.
    Definitions can only be made in cases where it's clear for any given value
    or object what definition will apply. For instance, 'Definition: a door is
    shiny if ...' is fine, but 'Definition: an open door is shiny if ...' is
    not allowed - Inform wouldn't know whether or not to apply it to the Big
    Blue Door (say), since it would only apply some of the time.
