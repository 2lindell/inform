Problem__ PM_ActivityVarValue
  >--> You wrote 'The printing the name activity has a value called the Mystery
    Quantity' (source text, line 3), but this does not give me a clear enough
    idea what it will hold. You need to say what kind of value: for instance,
    'A door has a number called street address.' is allowed because 'number' is
    specific about the kind of value.
Inform 7 has finished.
