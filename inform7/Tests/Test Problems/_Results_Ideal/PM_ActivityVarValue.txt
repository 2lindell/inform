Problem__ PM_ActivityVarValue
  >--> You wrote 'The printing the name activity has a value called the Mystery
    Quantity' (source text, line 3), but saying that a variable is a 'value'
    does not give me a clear enough idea what it will hold. You need to say
    what kind of value: for instance, 'A door has a number called street
    address.' is allowed because 'number' is specific about the kind of value.
