Problem__ PM_DefiniteCommonNoun
  >--> In 'Instead of opening a door when the door is closed' (source text, line 3),
    I'm not able to understand what specific thing is meant by the phrase 'the
    door'. You use the definite article 'the', which suggests you have a
    particular thing in mind, but then you go on to refer to a kind rather than
    something definite. Quite likely a human reading this sentence would find
    it obvious what you mean, but I don't. This often arises when writing
    something like: 'Instead of opening a door when the door is closed' - where
    clearly a human would understand that 'the door' refers to the same one in
    'a door' earlier. I can make sense of this only if you help: for example,
    'Instead of opening a door (called the portal) when the portal is closed'
    would work. So would 'Instead of opening a closed door'; or 'Instead of
    opening a door which is closed'. All of these alternatives help me by
    making clear that only one door is being talked about.
