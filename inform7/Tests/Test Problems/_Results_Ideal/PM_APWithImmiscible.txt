  >--> You wrote 'Instead of dropping the CD or inserting the CD into the jewel
    box' (source text, line 5), which seems to introduce a rule taking effect
    only 'dropping the CD or inserting the CD into the jewel box'. But this is
    a combination of actions which cannot be mixed. The only alternatives where
    'or' is allowed are cases where a choice of actions is given but applying
    to the same objects in each case. (So 'taking or dropping the CD' is
    allowed, but 'dropping the CD or inserting the CD into the jewel box' is
    not, because the alternatives there would make different use of objects
    from each other.)
