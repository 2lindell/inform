Problem__ PM_ThingReferringProperty
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the markee property as referring to a marker' (source
    text, line 5): but the value of that property is itself a kind of object,
    so that it cannot be understand as describing or referring to something. I
    can understand either/or properties, properties with a limited list of
    named possible values, numbers, times of day, or units.
