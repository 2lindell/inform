Problem__ PM_BadI6Inclusion
  >--> You wrote 'Include (- Global whatever = 1; -) somehow, anyhow' (source
    text, line 3): but this is not a form of I6 code inclusion I recognise,
    because the clause at the end telling me where to put the code excerpt is
    not one of the possibilities I know. The clause can either be blank (in
    which case I'll find somewhere sensible to put it), or 'when defining' plus
    the name of an object or kind of object, or 'before', 'instead of' or
    'after' a double-quoted name of a template layer segment, or of a part of
    one. For instance, 'before "Parser.i6t".' or 'after "Pronouns" in
    "Language.i6t".'
