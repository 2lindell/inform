  >--> In the sentence 'now the Laboratory is empty' (source text, line 4), it
    looks as if you intend 'the Laboratory is empty' to be a condition, but
    that seems to involve applying the adjective 'empty' to a room - and I have
    no definition of it which would apply in that situation. (Try looking it up
    in the Lexicon part of the Phrasebook index to see what definition(s)
    'empty' has.)
