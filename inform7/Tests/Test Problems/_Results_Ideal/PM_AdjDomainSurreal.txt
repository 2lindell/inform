  >--> In '"Frogs" is wibbly if it is 100 years old' (source text, line 3) you
    defined an adjective by '"Frogs" is wibbly if it is 100 years old'
    intending that it would apply to '"Frogs"': but this isn't allowed as the
    domain of a definition, since adjectives like this can be applied only to
    specific things, kinds of things or kinds of values: so 'Definition: a door
    is ajar if...' is fine, because a door is a kind of thing, and 'Definition:
    a number is prime if ...' is fine too, but 'Definition: 5 is prime if ...'
    is not allowed.
Inform 7 has finished.
