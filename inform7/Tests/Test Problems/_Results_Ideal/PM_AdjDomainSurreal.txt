  >--> In 'Definition' (source text, line 3) you defined an adjective by
    '"Frogs" is wibbly if it is 100 years old' intending that it would apply to
    '"Frogs"': but this isn't allowed as the domain of a definition, since
    adjectives like this can be applied only to specific things, kinds of
    things or kinds of values: so 'Definition: a door is ajar if...' is fine,
    because a door is a kind of thing, and 'Definition: a number is prime if
    ...' is fine too, but 'Definition: 5 is prime if ...' is not allowed.
