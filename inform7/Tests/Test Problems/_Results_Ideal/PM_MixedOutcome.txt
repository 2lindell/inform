  >--> You wrote 'Understand "bibble" or "bibble [something]" as "[pork
    chops]"' (source text, line 3): but grammar tokens must have the same
    outcome whatever the way they are reached, so writing a line like
    'Understand "within" or "next to [something]" as "[my token]" must be
    wrong: one way it produces a thing, the other way it doesn't.
