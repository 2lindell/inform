Inform 7 build 6L26 has started.
I've now read your source text, which is 25 words long.
Problem__ PM_HeadingStopsBeforeEndOfLine
  >--> The text 'Chapter I' (source text, line 1) seems to be a heading, but
    does not occupy the whole of its line of source text, which continues '.
    Home is a room' (source text, line 1). The rule is that a heading must
    occupy a whole single line which is the only sentence in its paragraph, so
    there must be a skipped line above and below. A heading must not contain a
    colon ':' or any full stop characters '.', even if they occur in an
    ellipsis '...' or a number '2.3.13'. (I mention that because sometimes this
    problem arises when a decimal point is misread as a full stop.)
