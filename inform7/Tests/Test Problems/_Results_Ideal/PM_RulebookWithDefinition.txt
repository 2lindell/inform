Problem__ PM_RulebookWithDefinition
  >--> You wrote 'Definition of heaven is a rulebook' (source text, line 3):
    but this would create a rulebook whose name begins with 'definition', which
    is forbidden since it would lead to ambiguities in the way people write
    rules. A rule beginning with 'Definition' is one which defines an
    adjective, whereas a rule belonging to a rulebook starts with the name of
    that rulebook, so a rulebook named 'to ...' would make such a rule
    inscrutable.
