Problem__ PM_EquationCantRoot-G
  >--> In 'Equation - triangle theorem a = root (b+c) where a is a length, b is
    a length, c is a length' (source text, line 3), you define an equation 'a =
    root (b+c)': but the square root function 'root' can only be used on
    quantities whose dimensions are themselves a square - for example, the root
    of the area 100 sq m makes sense (it's 10m), but the root of 4m doesn't
    make sense, because what's a square root of a meter?
