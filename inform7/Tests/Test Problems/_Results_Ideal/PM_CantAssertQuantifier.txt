  >--> You wrote 'The car is a vehicle in most rooms which are dark' (source
    text, line 3): but the relationship you describe is not exact enough, so
    that I cannot be sure of the initial situation. A specific relationship
    would be something like 'the box is a container in the Attic', rather than
    'the box is a container in a room which is dark' (fine, but which dark
    room? You must say).
