  >--> In 'Table of Exempla' (source text, line 3), I can't use the column
    heading 'model name (trade marked)' (source text, line 4). Brackets are
    only allowed in table column names when giving the kind of value which will
    be stored in the column. So 'poems (text)' is legal, but not 'poems
    (chiefly lyrical)'.
