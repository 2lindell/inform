  >--> You wrote 'A number is in the box' (source text, line 1): but this seems
    to give a worldly relationship to something intangible, possibly due to an
    accidental clash of names between a kind of value and something in the real
    world. I sometimes read sentences like 'There is a number on the door' or
    'A text is in the prayer-box' literally - thinking you mean a whole number
    or a piece of double-quoted text, and not realising you intended to make a
    brass number-plate or an old book. If that's the trouble, you can use
    'called': for instance, 'In the prayer-box is a thing called the text.'
