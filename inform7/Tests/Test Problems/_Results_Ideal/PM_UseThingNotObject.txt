Problem__ PM_UseThingNotObject
  >--> The grammar token 'object' in the sentence 'Understand "take [object]"
    as taking' (source text, line 1) would in some ways be the right logical
    way to suggest 'any object at all here', but Inform uses the special syntax
    '[thing]' for that. (Or '[things]' if multiple objects are allowed.)
