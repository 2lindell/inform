Problem__ PM_ActionBothValues
  >--> You wrote 'Decreeing is an action applying to one text and one number' (source
    text, line 3): but this action definition asks to have a single action
    apply to two different things which are not objects, and unfortunately a
    fundamental restriction is that an action can apply to two objects, or one
    object and one value, but not to two values. Sorry about that.
