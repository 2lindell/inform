Problem__ PM_ActivityOf
  >--> In the sentence 'carry out the printing the name of activity' (source
    text, line 4), I was expecting to read an activity, but instead found some
    text that I couldn't understand - 'printing the name of'. Activity names
    rarely end with 'of': for instance, when we talk about 'printing the name
    of something', properly speaking the activity is called 'printing the
    name'. Maybe that's it?
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      carry out the (printing the name of - activity) activity 
    But I didn't recognise 'printing the name of'.
