  >--> The grammar you give in 'Understand "[something related by
    possibilizing]" as a thing' (source text, line 13) contains a token which
    relates things to values - 'something related by possibilizing' (source
    text, line 1). (It would need to match the name of a temperature, which
    isn't a kind of thing.) At present, this is not allowed: only relations
    between kinds of object can be used in 'Understand' tokens.
