  >--> In the text at '"This is Foo, the leading pet shop[ [...] at random] in
    the Kidlington area."' (source text, line 1), the text substitution '[or]'
    ought to occur as the middle part of its construction, but it appears to be

    [at random]/[purely at random]/[then at random]/[then purely at
    random]/[sticky random]/[as decreasingly likely outcomes]/[in random
    order]/[cycling]/[stopping]'.)
