Problem__ PM_NameWithText
  >--> You wrote 'Some ships are defined by Table 1' (source text, line 1)
    (which asserts that 'b "v"' (source text, line 7) is/are 'Some ships' (source
    text, line 1)): but this seems to give something a name which contains
    double-quoted text, which is not allowed. If you do need quotes in a name,
    one option would be to write something like 'In the Saloon is 'Black'
    Jacques Bernoulli.'; but this problem message is often caused by an
    accident in punctuation, in which case you never intended to create an
    object - you thought that the text ended a sentence because it finished
    with sentence-ending punctuation, when in fact it didn't, so that I read
    the next words as following on.
Problem__ PM_TableDefiningNothing
  >--> In row 2 of 'Table 1 - Vessels' (source text, line 4), the entry 'b "v"'
    (source text, line 7) seems not to have defined a thing there, so perhaps
    the first column did not consist of new names?
