Problem__ PM_BadProvides
  >--> In the sentence 'The player provides 10' (source text, line 3), it looks
    as if you intend 'The player provides 10' to be asserting something, but
    that asks whether something provides something, and in Inform 'to provide'
    means that an object (or value) has a property attached - for instance,
    containers provide the property 'carrying capacity'. Here, though, we have
    a number rather than the name of a property.
