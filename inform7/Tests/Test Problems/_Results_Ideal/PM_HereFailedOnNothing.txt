  >--> You wrote 'Here is a nothing' (source text, line 3): but that is an
    assertion which puts nothing 'here', which looks as if it might be trying
    to give me negative rather than positive information. There's no need to
    tell me something like 'Here is nothing.': just don't put anything there.
