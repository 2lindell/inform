Problem__ PM_TemplateError
  >--> In an explicit Inform 6 code insertion, I recognise a few special
    notations in the form '{-command}'. This time, though, the unknown notation
    {-callv} has been used, and this is an error. (It seems very unlikely
    indeed that this could be legal Inform 6 which I'm misreading, but if so,
    try adjusting the spacing to make this problem message go away.)
Inform 7 has finished: 38 centiseconds used.
