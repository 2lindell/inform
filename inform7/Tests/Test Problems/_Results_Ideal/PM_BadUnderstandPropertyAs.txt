Problem__ PM_BadUnderstandPropertyAs
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the transparent property as referring to the White
    Mouse' (source text, line 3): but I don't understand what single thing or
    kind of thing that refers to, but it does need to be an object (or kind of
    object) and not some other sort of value. For instance, 'understand the
    transparent property as describing a container.' is okay because 'a
    container' is a kind of object.
