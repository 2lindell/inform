Problem__ PM_NoTopicsThatVary
  >--> You wrote 'Foo is a topic which varies' (source text, line 3): but
    'topics that vary' are not allowed, that is, a variable is not allowed to
    have 'topic' as its kind of value. (This would cause too much ambiguity
    with text variables, whose values look exactly the same.)
