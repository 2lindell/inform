Problem__ PM_NoninlineUsesNonvalues
  >--> In 'To disregard (act - an existing variable)' (source text, line 3),
    the text 'an existing variable' after the hyphen should tell me what kind
    of value goes here (like 'a number', or 'a vehicle'), but this is not a
    kind: it does describe something I can understand, but not something which
    can then be used as a value. (It would be allowed in low-level, so-called
    'inline' phrase definitions, but not in a standard phrase definition like
    this one.)
