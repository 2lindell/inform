  >--> You wrote 'Figure of Duck with Hat is the file "Duck with Hat.png"' (source
    text, line 1): but this is a name which is best avoided, because it would
    lead to confusion inside Inform. In general, try to avoid punctuation,
    quotation marks, or the words 'with' or 'having' in names like this.
    (Hyphens are fine, so by all means use a name like 'Church-with-Spire', if
    that will help.)
Inform 7 has finished: 16 centiseconds used.
