Problem__ PM_MisalignedCase
  >--> You wrote '1' (source text, line 6): but this seems to be misplaced
    since it is not a case within an 'if X is...', as it must be. Each case
    must be placed one tab stop in from the 'if X is...' to which it belongs,
    and the instructions for what to do in that case should be one tab stop
    further in still.
Problem__ PM_MisalignedIndentation
  >--> The phrase or rule definition 'When play begins' (source text, line 3)
    is written using the 'colon and indentation' syntax for its 'if's,
    'repeat's and 'while's, where blocks of phrases grouped together are
    indented one tab step inward from the 'if ...:' or similar phrase to which
    they belong. But the tabs here seem to be misaligned, and I can't determine
    the structure. The first phrase going awry in the definition seems to be
    'say "Look!"' (source text, line 7), in case that helps. This sometimes
    happens even when the code looks about right, to the eye, if rows of spaces
    have been used to indent phrases instead of tabs.
