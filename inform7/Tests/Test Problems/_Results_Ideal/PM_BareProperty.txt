Problem__ PM_BareProperty
  >--> You wrote 'A foo has a number' (source text, line 3): but this would
    create a property called 'number' or 'text', and although bare names of
    kinds are usually allowed as properties, these aren't. Instead, try '...
    has a number called position.' or something like that, to give the property
    a name.
