  >--> You wrote 'The description of the Winter Palace is east of the Hills' (source
    text, line 3): but this seems to say that a property of something is not
    simply equal to what happens at the moment to satisfy some relationship,
    but conceptually the same as that relationship, like saying 'the position
    of the weathervane is east of the church'. It would be fine to say 'the
    position of the weathervane is east' or 'the position of the weathervane is
    the meadow', because 'east' and 'meadow' are definite things.
