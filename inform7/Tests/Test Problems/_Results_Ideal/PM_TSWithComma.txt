Problem__ PM_TSWithComma
  >--> You wrote 'say "Hello [,]"' (source text, line 3): but a substitution
    contains a comma ',', which is (for obscure reasons) against the rules for
    text substitutions. (You may be able to get around this by placing the
    phrase containing the comma in round brackets '(' and ')', which reduces
    the risk of ambiguity.)
Inform 7 has finished.
