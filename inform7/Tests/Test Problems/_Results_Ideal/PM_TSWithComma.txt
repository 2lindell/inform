Problem__ PM_TSWithComma
  >--> You wrote 'say "Hello [,]"' (source text, line 3): but a substitution
    contains a comma ',', which is against the rules, because 'say' is a
    special phrase in which the comma divides items in a list of things to say,
    and so it loses its ordinary meanings. Because of this, no text
    substitution can contain a comma. (If you're trying to use a value produced
    by a phrase with a phrase option - say 'the best route from A to B, using
    even locked doors' - you'll need to put this in a 'let' variable first and
    then say that, or else define a better text substitution to do the job for
    you.)
