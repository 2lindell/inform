Problem__ PM_NoSuchTemplate
  >--> You wrote 'Include (- ... -) before "Mount Cotopaxi.i6t"' (source text, line 3):
    but no template file of that name was ever read in, so this attempt to
    intervene had no effect. The template files have names like 'Output.i6t',
    'Parser.i6t' and so on. (Looking at the typeset form of the template,
    available at the Inform website, may help.)
