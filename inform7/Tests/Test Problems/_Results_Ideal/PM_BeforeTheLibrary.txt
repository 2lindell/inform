  >--> You wrote 'Include (- Global whatever = 1; -) before the library' (source
    text, line 3): but this syntax was withdrawn in January 2008, in favour of
    a more finely controlled I6 inclusion command. The effect you want can
    probably be achieved by writing 'after "Definitions.i6t".' instead of
    'before the library.'
