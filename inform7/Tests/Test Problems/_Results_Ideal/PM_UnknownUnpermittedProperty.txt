Problem__ PM_UnknownUnpermittedProperty
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the transparent property as referring to the
    Memorial' (source text, line 3): but that property is not allowed for the
    thing or kind in question, just as (ordinarily) 'understand the open
    property as describing a device' would not be allowed because it makes no
    sense to call a device 'open'.
