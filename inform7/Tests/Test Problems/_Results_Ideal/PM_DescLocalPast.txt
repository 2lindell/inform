  >--> You wrote 'if T had been the School' (source text, line 5): but
    conditions written in the past tense cannot refer to temporary values,
    because they have no past. For instance, the name given in a 'repeat...'
    can't be talked about as having existed before, and similarly the pronoun
    'it' changes its meaning often, so we can't safely talk about 'it' in the
    past.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (t had been the school - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    t had been the school = a condition
