  >--> You wrote 'if the gem (called cc) is carried' (source text, line 7): but
    a 'called' name can only be given to something which is described vaguely,
    and can't be given to a definite object or value. So 'if a thing (called
    the gadget) is carried' is allowed, but 'if the X-Ray Zapper (called the
    gadget) is carried' isn't allowed - if it's the X-Ray Zapper, then call it
    that.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (gem ( called cc ) is carried - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    gem ( called cc ) is carried = a condition
