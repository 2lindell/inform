  >--> You wrote 'Understand "button [something] on [something] with
    [something]" as taking' (source text, line 3): but there can be at most two
    varying parts to a line of grammar, so 'put [something] in [a container]'
    is allowed but 'put [something] in [something] beside [a door]' is not.
Inform 7 has finished.
