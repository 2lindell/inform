  >--> You wrote 'Peter groks pink which is the hue of the player' (source text, line 11),
    but the nameless object created in the sentence 'Peter groks pink which is
    the hue of the player' (source text, line 11) seems to be set equal to
    something in a complicated relationship with something else again, which is
    too much for me. Perhaps you're trying to do two things at once, and it
    would be clearer to write it as two sentences?
