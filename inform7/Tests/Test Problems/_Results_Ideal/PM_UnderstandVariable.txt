Problem__ PM_UnderstandVariable
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "fooble" as the player' (source text, line 3): but
    this meaning is a value that varies, whereas I need something fixed. (The
    most common case of this is saying that something should be understood as
    'the player', which is actually a variable, because the perspective of play
    can change. Writing 'yourself' instead will usually do.)
Inform 7 has finished.
