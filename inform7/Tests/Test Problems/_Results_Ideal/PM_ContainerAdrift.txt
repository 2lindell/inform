  >--> You wrote 'A container is a kind of supporter' (source text, line 2):
    but 'container' and 'supporter' are not allowed to be kinds of each other,
    because they're too fundamental to the way Inform models the physical
    world. Both are kinds of 'thing', but they are different, and no object is
    allowed to belong to both at once.
