  >--> You wrote 'The description of a freshwater fish is "Red."' (source text, line 10):
    but this tries to set a property for a complicated generality of items all
    at once, which can lead to ambiguities. For instance, 'The description of
    an open door is "It's open."' is not allowed: if we followed Inform's
    normal conventions strictly, that would be an instruction to create a new,
    nameless, open door and give it the description. But this is very unlikely
    to be what the writer intended, given the presence of the adjective to make
    it seem as if a particular door is meant. So in fact we reject such
    sentences unless they refer only to a kind, without adjectives: 'The
    description of a door is "It's a door."' is fine. (If the idea is actually
    to make the description change in play, we could write a rule like 'Instead
    of examining an open door, say "It's open."'; or we could set the
    description of every door to "[if open]It's open.[otherwise]It's closed.".)
