Problem__ PM_AdjectiveMisapplied
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> In the sentence '(This is the okay beat; closed, dramatic, 234,
    spontaneous .)' (source text, line 9), it looks as if you intend '(This is
    the okay beat; closed, dramatic, 234, spontaneous .)' to be asserting
    something, but that seems to involve applying the adjective 'closed' to a
    dialogue beat - and I have no definition of it which would apply in that
    situation. (Try looking it up in the Lexicon part of the Phrasebook index
    to see what definition(s) 'closed' has.)
Problem__ PM_UnrecognisedBeatProperty
  >--> The dialogue beat '(This is the okay beat; closed, dramatic, 234,
    spontaneous .)' (source text, line 9) should apparently be '234', but that
    isn't something I recognise as a property which a beat can have.
Inform 7 has finished.
