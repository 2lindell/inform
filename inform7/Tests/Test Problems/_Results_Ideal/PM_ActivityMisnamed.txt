  >--> You wrote 'Painting is an activity on colors' (source text, line 5): but
    the name of this activity implies that it acts on nothing, which doesn't

    brushes' isn't allowed because the activity's name doesn't end with
    'something': it should be 'Painting something is an activity on brushes'.
