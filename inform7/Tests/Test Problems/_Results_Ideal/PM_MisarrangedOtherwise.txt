Problem__ PM_MisarrangedOtherwise
  >--> You wrote 'otherwise if 1 is 3' (source text, line 8): but this seems to
    be misplaced since it is out of sequence within its 'if', with an
    'otherwise if...' coming after the more general 'otherwise' rather than
    before. (Note that an 'otherwise' or 'otherwise if' must be vertically
    underneath the 'if' to which it corresponds, at the same indentation.
