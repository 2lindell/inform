  >--> You wrote 'Every turn has a number called Trevor' (source text, line 3):
    but a rulebook has to be formally referred to in a way making clear that it
    is indeed a rulebook when we give it named values, to reduce the risk of
    ambiguity. So 'The every turn rulebook has a number called the accumulated
    bonus' is fine, but 'Every turn has a number called...' is not. (I'm
    insisting on the presence of the word 'rulebook' because the syntax is so
    close to that for giving properties to objects, and it's important to avoid
    mistakes here.)
