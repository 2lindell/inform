  >--> You wrote 'now at most three people are in Stanford' (source text, line 4):
    but this can't be made true with 'now', because it is too vague about what
    it applies to. It's fine to say 'now all the doors are open' or 'now none
    of the doors is open', because that clearly tells me which doors are
    affected; but if you write 'now six of the doors are open' or 'now almost
    all the doors are open', what am I to do?

    again, this can't be made true with 'now'.

    again, this can't be made true with 'now'.
