  >--> You wrote 'let Q be a phrase values -> values' (source text, line 4),
    but although 'a phrase values -> values' is the name of a kind, it isn't a
    definite kind and is instead a general description which might apply to
    many different kinds. (For example, 'let R be a relation' is vague because
    it doesn't make clear what R will relate - 'let R be a relation of numbers'
    would be fine.)
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (q - a new name) be (a phrase values -> values - description of
    relations of values) 
    2.  let (q - a new name) be (a phrase values -> values - name of kind) 
    3.  let (q - a new name) be (a phrase values -> values - value) 
    4.  let (q - a temporary named value) be (a phrase values -> values - value)
    
    I recognised:
    a phrase values -> values = a description of phrases k -> l
    The name 'q' doesn't yet exist.
