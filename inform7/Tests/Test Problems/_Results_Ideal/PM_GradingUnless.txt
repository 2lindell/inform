Problem__ PM_GradingUnless
  >--> You gave as a definition 'a thing is stately unless its carrying
    capacity is 10 or more' (source text, line 3): but 'unless' is not allowed
    when defining grading adjectives, so 'Definition: a container is large if
    its carrying capacity is 10 or more.' is fine, but so 'Definition: a
    container is modest unless its carrying capacity is 10 or more.' is not -
    of course a similar effect could be achieved by 'Definition: a container is
    modest if its carrying capacity is 9 or less.'
