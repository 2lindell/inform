Problem__ PM_InlineCopy
  >--> You wrote 'go awry' (source text, line 8), which I read as making use of
    the phrase 'To go awry' (source text, line 3). This in turn has what's
    called an 'inline' definition, written in a technical notation usually
    needed only by the Standard Rules or other low-level extensions. The
    definition here is '{-copy:to-bogus:from-bogus};' but it seems to be
    broken. The command to {-copy:...}, which asks to copy 'from-bogus' into
    'to-bogus', has gone wrong: I couldn't work those out.
