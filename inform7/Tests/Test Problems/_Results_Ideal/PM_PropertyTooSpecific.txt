Problem__ PM_PropertyTooSpecific
  >--> You wrote 'A room has an open container called the bucket' (source text, line 1),
    which I am reading as a request to make a new named property - a value
    associated with an object and which has a name. The request seems to say
    that the value in question is 'open container', but this is too specific a
    description. (Instead, a kind of value (such as 'number') or a kind of
    object (such as 'room' or 'thing') should be given. To get a property whose
    contents can be any kind of object, use 'object'.)
