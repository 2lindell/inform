Problem__ PM_ExtMiswordedBeginsHere
  >--> has a misworded 'begins here' sentence ('Extmiswordedbeginshere
    Extension'), which contains no 'by'. Recall that every extension should
    begin with a sentence such as 'Quantum Mechanics by Max Planck begins
    here.', and end with a matching 'Quantum Mechanics ends here.', perhaps
    with documentation to follow.
