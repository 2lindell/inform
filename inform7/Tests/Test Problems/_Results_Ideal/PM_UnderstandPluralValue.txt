Problem__ PM_UnderstandPluralValue
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "twos" as the plural of 2' (source text, line 3):
    but 'understand' as a plural can only apply to things, rooms or kinds of
    things or rooms, so 'Understand "paperwork" as the plural of a document.'
    is fine (assuming a document is a kind of thing), but 'Understand "dozens"
    as the plural of 12' is not.
Inform 7 has finished.
