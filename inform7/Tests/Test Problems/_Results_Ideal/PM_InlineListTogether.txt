Problem__ PM_InlineListTogether
  >--> You wrote 'go awry' (source text, line 8), which I read as making use of
    the phrase 'To go awry' (source text, line 3). This in turn has what's
    called an 'inline' definition, written in a technical notation usually
    needed only by the Standard Rules or other low-level extensions. The
    definition here is '{-list-together:brief};' but it seems to be broken. The
    only legal forms here are {-list-together:articled} and
    {-list-together:unarticled}.
