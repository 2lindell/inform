  >--> You wrote 'Five rooms are lighted' (source text, line 1): but multiple
    objects can only be put into relationships, by saying something like 'In
    the Drawing Room are two women.', and all other assertions with multiple
    objects are disallowed: so 'Three doors are open.' is rejected - I can't
    tell which three.
