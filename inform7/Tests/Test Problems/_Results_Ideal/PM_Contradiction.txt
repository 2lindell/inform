Problem__ PM_Contradiction
  >--> You wrote 'The Other Ballroom is east of the Hall' (source text, line 5),
    but in another sentence 'The Ballroom is east of the Hall' (source text, line 3):
    but this looks like a contradiction, which might be because I have
    misunderstood what was meant to be the subject of one or both of those
    sentences.
Problem__ PM_SpatialContradiction
  >--> You wrote 'Bob is in Home' (source text, line 12), but also 'Bob is in
    the autre place' (source text, line 13): that seems to be saying that the
    same object (Bob) must be in two different places (Home and Autre place).
    This looks like a contradiction. This sometimes happens as a result of a
    sentence like 'Every person carries a bag', when Inform doesn't know 'bag'
    as the name of any kind - so that it makes only a single thing called
    'bag', and then the sentence looks as if it says everyone is carrying the
    same bag.
