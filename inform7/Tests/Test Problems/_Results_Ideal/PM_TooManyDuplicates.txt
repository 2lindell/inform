Problem__ PM_TooManyDuplicates
  >--> You wrote '101 Dalmatians are in London' (source text, line 3): but at
    most 100 duplicates can be made at any one time, so '157 chairs are in the
    UN General Assembly' will not be allowed. The system for handling
    duplicates during play becomes too slow and awkward when there are so many.
