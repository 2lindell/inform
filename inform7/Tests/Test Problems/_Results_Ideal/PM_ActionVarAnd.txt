Problem__ PM_ActionVarAnd
  >--> You wrote 'The taking action has a number called cash and carry' (source
    text, line 3), which I am reading as a request to make a new named variable
    for an action - a value associated with a action and which has a name. The
    request seems to say that the name in question is 'cash and carry', but I'd
    prefer to avoid 'and', 'or', 'with', or 'having' in such names, please.
