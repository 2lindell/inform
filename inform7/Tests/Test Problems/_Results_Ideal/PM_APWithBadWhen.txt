  >--> You wrote 'Instead of jumping when Orinoco asdl lkjhlkjhlkh' (source
    text, line 3), which seems to introduce a rule taking effect only 'when
    Orinoco asdl lkjhlkjhlkh'. But this condition did not make sense, so I am
    unable to accept this rule.

  >--> You wrote 'Instead of jumping when Orinoco is nowhere' (source text, line 5),
    which seems to introduce a rule taking effect only 'when Orinoco is
    nowhere'. But this condition did not make sense, perhaps because 'nowhere'
    tends not to be allowed in Inform conditions? (Whereas 'no room' is usually
    allowed.)
Problem__ PM_APWithBadWhen
  >--> You wrote 'Instead of jumping when Orinoco has nothing' (source text, line 7),
    which seems to introduce a rule taking effect only 'when Orinoco has
    nothing'. But this condition did not make sense, perhaps because 'nothing'
    tends not to be allowed in Inform conditions? (Whereas 'no thing' is
    usually allowed.)
