Problem__ PM_LineWithoutBeat
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote 'Marcellus: "What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?"' (source
    text, line 5): but this dialogue material seems to appear before any beat
    has begun, which is not allowed - every line or choice has to be part of a
    'beat', which has to be introduced with a bracketed paragraph looking like
    a stage direction in a play.
Inform 7 has finished.
