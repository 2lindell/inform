  >--> You wrote 'Taking something is Xanadu' (source text, line 3): but an
    action can't be the same as a thing, so my guess is that this is an attempt
    to categorise an action which went wrong because there was already
    something of that name in existence. For instance, 'Taking something is
    theft' would fail if 'theft' was already a value. (But it can also happen
    with a sentence which tries to set several actions at once to a named kind
    of action, like 'Taking and dropping are manipulation.' - only one can be
    named at a time.)
