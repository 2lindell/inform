  >--> In 'Equation 2 Abacadabras = Abacadabras2 + Fish100 where Abacadabras is
    a number, Abacadabras2 is a number, Fish100 is a number' (source text, line 3),
    you define an equation which mentions the symbol 'Abacadabras': but a
    symbol in a equation has to be a sequence of one to ten letters optionally
    followed by a number from 0 to 99, so 'G', 'm', 'pi' and 'KE1' are all
    legal symbol names. But this one is not.
