Problem__ PM_CantCreateImplicitly
  >--> The sentence '7 is associated with a number' (source text, line 6) seems
    to be asking me to create a new value (a number) in order to be part of a
    relationship, but this isn't a kind of value which I can just create new
    values for.
Problem__ PM_IdentityUnclear
  >--> The sentence '7 is associated with a number' (source text, line 6) seems
    to tell me that 'number' and '(something not given an explicit name)' have
    to be the same, but it looks odd to me. 'number' is something generic - not
    something definite; but '(something not given an explicit name)' is
    (presumably) something specific. So it's as if you'd written 'A room is the
    Sydney Opera House'. (Which room, exactly? You see the trouble.)
