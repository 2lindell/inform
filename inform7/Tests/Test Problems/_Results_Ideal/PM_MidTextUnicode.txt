Problem__ PM_MidTextUnicode
  >--> In the sentence 'admire unicode Greek capital letter lambda' (source
    text, line 9), I was expecting to read a unicode character, but instead
    found some text that I couldn't understand - 'unicode Greek capital letter
    lambda'. Maybe you intended this to produce a Unicode character? Unicode
    characters can be written either using their decimal numbers - for
    instance, 'Unicode 2041' - or with their standard names - 'Unicode Latin
    small ligature oe'. For the full list of those names, see the Unicode
    standard version 15.0.0.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      admire (unicode greek capital letter lambda - unicode character) 
    But I didn't recognise 'unicode greek capital letter lambda'.
