Problem__ PM_TotalTableColumn
  >--> You wrote 'let T be the total drongo of people' (source text, line 10):
    but this seems to be an attempt to total up the column of a table, whereas
    it's only legal to use 'total' for properties.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      total (drongo - arithmetic values valued property) of (people - description
    of values) 
    I recognised:
    drongo = a numbers valued table column
    people = a description of people
