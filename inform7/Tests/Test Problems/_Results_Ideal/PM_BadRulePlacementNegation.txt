  >--> In 'The splodge rule is not listed after the flibble rule in the instead
    rules' (source text, line 7), you used the special verb 'to be listed' -
    which specifies how rules are listed in rulebooks - in a way too
    complicated to be accompanied by 'not', so that the result was too vague.
    The usual form is: 'The summer breeze rule is not listed in the meadow
    noises rulebook'.
