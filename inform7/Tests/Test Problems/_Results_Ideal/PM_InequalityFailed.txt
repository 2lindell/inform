  >--> In the sentence 'if 23 is less than the Entire Game' (source text, line 4),
    it looks as if you intend '23 is less than the Entire Game' to be a
    condition, but that would mean comparing two kinds of value which cannot

    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (23 is less than the entire game - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    23 is less than the entire game = a condition
