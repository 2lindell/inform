Problem__ PM_VerbRelationUnknown
  >--> You wrote 'The verb to imagine (he imagines, they imagine) implies the
    fidgety relation' (source text, line 1): but new verbs can only be defined
    in terms of existing relations, all of which have names ending 'relation':
    thus '...implies the possession relation' is an example of a valid
    definition, this being one of the relations built into Inform.
