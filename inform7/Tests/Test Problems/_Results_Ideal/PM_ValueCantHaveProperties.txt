Problem__ PM_ValueCantHaveProperties
  >--> The sentence 'A number can be green or blue' (source text, line 3)
    looked to me as if it might be trying to create an either/or property which
    would be held by all of the values of a rather large kind (a number). But
    this is a kind which is not allowed to have properties, because the storage
    requirements would be too difficult. For instance, scenes can have
    properties like this, but numbers can't: that's because there are only a
    few, named scenes, but there is an almost unlimited range of numbers. (That
    doesn't mean you can't create adjectives using 'Definition: ...' - it's
    only when storage would be needed that this limitation kicks in.)
