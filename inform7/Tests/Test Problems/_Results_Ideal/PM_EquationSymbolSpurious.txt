Problem__ PM_EquationSymbolSpurious
  >--> In 'let F be given by Equation 2 where a = 5, Z = 10' (source text, line 9),
    you define an equation which mentions the symbol 'Z': but when 'where' is
    used to supply values to plug into a named equation as part of a 'let'
    phrase, you can only supply values for symbols actually used in that
    equation. This one doesn't seem to occur there.
