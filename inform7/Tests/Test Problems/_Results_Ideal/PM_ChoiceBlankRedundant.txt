Problem__ PM_ChoiceBlankRedundant
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote '--' (source text, line 9): but this use of a bare '--'
    divider looks redundant, occurring at the start or end of a run of choices.
    '--' on its own should be used only where there's a need to mark a division
    point between two sets of choices running on from one to the other.
Problem__ PM_ChoiceBlankRedundant
  >--> You wrote '--' (source text, line 13): again, this use of a bare '--'
    divider looks redundant.
