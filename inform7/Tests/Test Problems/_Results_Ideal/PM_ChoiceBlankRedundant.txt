Problem__ PM_ChoiceBlankRedundant
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote '-> another choice' (source text, line 9): but this use of '->
    another choice' looks redundant, occurring at the start or end of a set of
    options. '-> another choice' should be used only where there's a need to
    mark a division point between two sets of options running on from one to
    the other.
Problem__ PM_ChoiceBlankRedundant
  >--> You wrote '-> another choice' (source text, line 13): again, this use of
    '-> another choice' looks redundant.
Inform 7 has finished.
