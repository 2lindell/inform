  >--> I can't find the extension 'Bogus Extension by Mr Nobody', which seems
    not to be installed, but was requested by: 'Include Bogus Extension by Mr
    Nobody' (source text, line 1). You can get hold of extensions which people
    have made public at the Inform website, www.inform7.com, or by using the
    Public Library in the Extensions panel.
