  >--> In the sentence 'if the player is heavier than 70cm' (source text, line 11),
    it looks as if you intend 'player is heavier than 70cm' to be a condition,
    but that ought to make a comparison of weight not height.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (player is heavier than 70cm - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    player is heavier than 70cm = a condition
