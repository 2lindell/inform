Problem__ PM_BadRulePreambleWhen
  >--> The punctuation makes me think 'When the badger runs' (source text, line 3)
    should be a definition of a phrase or a rule, but it doesn't begin as it
    should, with either 'To' (e.g. 'To flood the riverplain:'), 'Definition:',
    a name for a rule (e.g. 'This is the devilishly cunning rule:'), 'At' plus
    a time (e.g. 'At 11:12 PM:' or 'At the time when the clock chimes:') or the
    name of a rulebook. As your rule begins with 'When', it may be worth
    noting that in December 2006 the syntax used by Inform for timed events
    changed: the old syntax 'When the sky falls in:' to create a named event,
    the sky falls in, became 'At the time when the sky falls in:'. This was
    changed to avoid confusion with rules relating to when scenes begin or end.
    Or perhaps you meant to say that something would only happen when some
    condition held. Inform often allows this, but the 'when...' part tends to
    be at the end, not up front - for instance, 'Understand "blue" as the deep
    crevasse when the location is the South Pole.'
