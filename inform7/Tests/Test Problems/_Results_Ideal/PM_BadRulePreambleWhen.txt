Problem__ PM_BadRulePreambleWhen
  >--> The punctuation makes me think 'When the badger runs' (source text, line 3)
    should be a definition of a phrase or a rule, but it doesn't begin as it
    should, with either 'To' (e.g. 'To flood the riverplain:'), 'Definition:',
    a name for a rule (e.g. 'This is the devilishly cunning rule:'), 'At' plus
    a time (e.g. 'At 11:12 PM:' or 'At the time when the clock chimes:') or the
    name of a rulebook. Perhaps you meant to say that something would only
    happen when some condition held. Inform often allows this, but the
    'when...' part tends to be at the end, not up front - for instance,
    'Understand "blue" as the deep crevasse when the location is the South
    Pole.'
Inform 7 has finished.
