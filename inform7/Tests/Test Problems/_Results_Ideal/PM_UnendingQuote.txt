    This probably means that a quotation mark is missing somewhere. If you are
    using Inform with syntax colouring, look for where the quoted-text colour
    starts. (Sometimes this problem turns up because a piece of quoted text
    contains a text substitution in square brackets which in turn contains
    another piece of quoted text - this is not allowed, and causes me to lose
    track.)
I've now read your source text, which is 0 words long.
