Problem__ PM_WithEitherOrValue
  >--> The sentence ''Knuth is a man with opaque 10' (source text, line 3)'
    seems to be trying to create something which has 'opaque 10', where the
    opaque property is being set equal to 10. But this made no sense to me,
    because opaque is an either/or property and cannot have a value.
