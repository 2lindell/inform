Problem__ PM_BadRepeatDomain
  >--> You wrote 'repeat with X running through numbers' (source text, line 4):
    but this describes a collection of values which can't be repeated through,
    because the possible range is too large (or has no sensible ordering). For
    instance, you can 'repeat with D running through doors' because there are
    only a small number of doors and they can be put in order of creation. But
    you can't 'repeat with N running through numbers' because numbers are
    without end.
