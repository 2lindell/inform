Problem__ PM_BadRepeatDomain
  >--> In 'repeat with X running through numbers' (source text, line 4), you
    seem to want to repeat through all possible values which have the kind 'a
    number', and there are just too many of those. For instance, you can
    'repeat with D running through doors' because there are only a small number
    of doors, but you can't 'repeat with N running through numbers' because
    numbers are without end.
