Problem__ PM_NoSuchVerbComma
  >--> In the sentence 'At 1 PM, say "Yes."' (source text, line 3), I can't
    find a verb that I know how to deal with. (I notice there's a comma here,
    which is sometimes used to abbreviate rules which would normally be written
    with a colon - for instance, 'Before taking: say "You draw breath."' can be
    abbreviated to 'Before taking, say...' - but that's only allowed for
    Before, Instead and After rules. I mention all this in case you meant this
    sentence as a rule in some rulebook, but used a comma where there should
    have been a colon ':'?)
