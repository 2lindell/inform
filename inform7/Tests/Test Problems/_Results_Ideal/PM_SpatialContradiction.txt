  >--> You wrote 'There is a hairstyle' (source text, line 5), but in another
    sentence 'There is a hairstyle' (source text, line 4): but this looks like
    a contradiction, which might be because I have misunderstood what was meant
    to be the subject of one or both of those sentences.

  >--> You wrote 'There is a hairstyle' (source text, line 4), but also 'There
    is a hairstyle' (source text, line 5): that seems to be saying that the
    same object (hairspray) must be in two different places (nameless hairstyle
    created in the sentence 'There is a hairstyle' (source text, line 4) and
    nameless hairstyle created in the sentence 'There is a hairstyle' (source
    text, line 5)). This looks like a contradiction. This sometimes happens as
    a result of a sentence like 'Every person carries a bag', when Inform
    doesn't know 'bag' as the name of any kind - so that it makes only a single
    thing called 'bag', and then the sentence looks as if it says everyone is
    carrying the same bag.
Inform 7 has finished.
