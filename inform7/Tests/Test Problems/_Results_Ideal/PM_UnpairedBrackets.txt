Problem__ PM_UnpairedBrackets
  >--> You wrote 'let F be given by F = (1 + 1, where F is a number' (source
    text, line 4): but this is a phrase which I don't recognise, perhaps
    because it uses brackets '(' and ')' or braces '{' and '}' in a way that
    doesn't make sense to me. Each open '(' or '{' has to have a matching ')'
    or '}'.
