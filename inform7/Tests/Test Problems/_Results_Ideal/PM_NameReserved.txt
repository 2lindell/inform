Problem__ PM_NameReserved
  >--> You wrote 'Storage is a kind of thing' (source text, line 3): but this
    seems to give something a name which is reserved for Inform's own internal
    use, so is not allowed. There are only a few of these - 'storage',
    'variable', 'condition', 'phrase' and 'action', for example. But whatever
    you were making here, you'll need to call it something else.

    give something a name which is reserved for Inform's own internal use.
