  >--> You wrote 'Understand "hit 3" as a mistake ("You shouldn't hit someone
    while Beth is in the room.") when the location of the player is the
    location of Beth' (source text, line 36): but this command verb now has too
    many Understand possibilities, that is, there are too many 'Understand
    "whatever ..." as ...' which share the same initial word 'whatever'. The
    best way to get around this is to try to consolidate some of those lines
    together, perhaps by using slashes to combine alternative wordings, or by
    defining new grammar tokens [in square brackets].
