Problem__ PM_TableUnknownEntry
  >--> In 'Table 1 - Admirals' (source text, line 3), I'm reading the text
    'zxcvzcvzcvz' (source text, line 5) in column 1 (admiral) of row 1, but I
    don't know what this means. This should usually be a value, like a number
    or a piece of text, or a blank entry marker '--', but in some circumstances
    it can also be an action (such as 'taking the box'), or a kind (such as 'a
    number') to show what sort of values will go into an otherwise blank row.
Problem__ PM_TableKindlessColumn
  >--> Column 1 (admiral) of 'Table 1 - Admirals' (source text, line 3)
    contains no values and doesn't tell me anything about its kind.
