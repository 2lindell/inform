Problem__ PM_IndentedBeat
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote '(About the paranormal .)' (source text, line 5): but this
    dialogue beat seems to be indented, which in dialogue would mean that it is
    part of something above it. But all beats (unlike lines) are free-standing,
    and should not be indented.
Inform 7 has finished.
