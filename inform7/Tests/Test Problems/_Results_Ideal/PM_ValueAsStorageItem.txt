  >--> You wrote 'increment the zork' (source text, line 5), but 'zork' is a
    value, not a place where a value is stored. For example, if 'The tally is
    a number that varies.', then I can 'increment the tally', but I can't
    'increment 37' - the number 37 is always what it is. Similarly, I can't
    'increment the number of people'. Phrases like 'increment' work only on
    stored values, like values that vary, or table entries.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      increment (zork - a stored value) 
    I recognised:
    zork = an instruction to work out a number

    place where a value is stored. For example, if 'The tally is a number that
