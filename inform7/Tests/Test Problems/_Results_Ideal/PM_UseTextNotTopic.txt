Problem__ PM_UseTextNotTopic
  >--> The grammar token 'a topic' in the sentence 'Understand "t [a person]
    about [a topic]" as telling it about' (source text, line 3) would in some
    ways be the right logical way to suggest 'any words at all here', but
    Inform in actually uses the special syntax '[text]' for that. This is
    partly for historical reasons, but also because '[text]' is a token which
    can't be used in every sort of Understand grammar - for example, it can't
    be used with 'matches' or in descriptions of actions or in table columns;
    it's really intended only for defining new commands.
