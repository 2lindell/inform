Problem__ PM_UnclosedSubstitution
  >--> You wrote 'say "[foo the player bar"' (source text, line 5): but the
    text here uses an open square bracket '[', which opens a substitution in
    the text, but doesn't close it again, so that the result is malformed. (If
    you just wanted a literal open square bracket, use '[bracket]'.)
