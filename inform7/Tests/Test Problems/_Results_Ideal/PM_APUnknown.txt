  >--> You wrote 'Instead of going arfle barfle gloop while Burrow is dark' (source
    text, line 3), which seems to introduce a rule taking effect only if the
    action is 'going arfle barfle gloop while Burrow is dark'. The part after
    'when' (or 'while') was fine, but the earlier words did not make sense as a
    description of an action. I am unable to place this rule into any rulebook.
Problem__ PM_APWithBadWhen
  >--> You wrote 'Instead of going arfle barfle gloop when spoliation obviates'
    (source text, line 5), which seems to introduce a rule taking effect only
    'when spoliation obviates'. But this condition did not make sense, so I am
    unable to accept this rule.
