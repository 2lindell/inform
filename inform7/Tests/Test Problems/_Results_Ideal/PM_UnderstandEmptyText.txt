Problem__ PM_UnderstandEmptyText
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "" as the artifact' (source text, line 3): but
    'understand' should be followed by text which contains at least one word or
    square-bracketed token, so for instance 'understand "take [something]" as
    taking' is fine, but 'understand "" as the fog' is not. The same applies to
    the contents of 'topic' columns in tables, since those are also
    instructions for understanding.
Inform 7 has finished.
