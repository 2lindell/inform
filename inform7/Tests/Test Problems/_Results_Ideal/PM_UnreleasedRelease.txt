Inform 7 build 6M55 has started.
I've now read your source text, which is 7 words long.
I've also read Standard Rules by Graham Nelson, which is 42526 words long.
I've also read English Language by Graham Nelson, which is 2288 words long.
Problem__ PM_UnreleasedRelease
  >--> This is supposed to be a source text which only contains release
    instructions to bind up an existing story file (for instance, one produced
    using Inform 6). That's because the instruction 'Release along with an
    existing story file' is present. So the only way to build the project is to
    use the Release option - not, for instance, Go or Replay, because it would
    make no sense to translate the source text into something to play. (Of
    course, you can play the released story file using an interpreter such as
    Zoom or Windows Frotz, etc.: just not here, within Inform.)
Inform 7 has finished: 32 centiseconds used.
