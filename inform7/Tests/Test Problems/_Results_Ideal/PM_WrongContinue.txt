  >--> You wrote 'continue' (source text, line 4): but this is a phrase which I
    don't recognise, and which isn't defined. Perhaps you wanted the phrase
    which would skip to the next repetition of a loop, since that's written
    'continue' in some programming languages (such as C and Inform 6)? If so,
    what you want is 'next'.
