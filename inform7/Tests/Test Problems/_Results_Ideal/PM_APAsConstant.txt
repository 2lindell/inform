  >--> You wrote 'taking' (source text, line 5): but this is a description of
    an action which is too vague to be used as a constant value, and should
    either be something like 'taking action' (for the action in the abstract)
    or 'taking the beach ball' (for a definitely specific action), but not
    something like 'taking' or 'taking a container' which refer to a whole
    collection of possible actions.
Inform 7 has finished.
