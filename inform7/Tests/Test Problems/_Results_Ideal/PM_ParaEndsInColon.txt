Inform 7 build 6M25 has started.
I've now read your source text, which is 4 words long.
Problem__ PM_ParaEndsInColon
  >--> The text 'Rog is a room:' (source text, line 1) seems to end a paragraph
    with a colon. (Rule declarations can end a sentence with a colon, so maybe
    there's accidentally a skipped line here?)
Inform 7 has finished: 3 centiseconds used.
