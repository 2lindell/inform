Problem__ PM_BadTemplateAtSign
  >--> An unknown '@...' marker has been found at column 0 in raw Inform 6
    template material: specifically, '@fish;'. ('@' has a special meaning in
    this first column, and this might clash with its use to introduce an
    assembly-language opcode in Inform 6: if that's a problem, you can avoid it
    simply by putting one or more spaces or tabs in front of the opcode(s) to
    keep them clear of the left margin.)
