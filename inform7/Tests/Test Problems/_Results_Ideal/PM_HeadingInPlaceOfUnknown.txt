  >--> In the sentence 'Section of Minimal Grammar (in place of Section SR4/10
    - Mythical Stuff in Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 3),
    it looks as if you intend to replace a section of source text from the
    extension 'Standard Rules by Graham Nelson', but that extension does not
    seem to have any heading called 'Section SR4/10 - Mythical Stuff'. (The
    version I loaded was 5/190315.)
