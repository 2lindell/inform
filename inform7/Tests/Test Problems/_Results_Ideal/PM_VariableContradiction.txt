Problem__ PM_VariableContradiction
  >--> You wrote 'The command prompt is "What do you want to do? >"' (source
    text, line 3), but in another sentence 'The command prompt is ">"' (the
    Standard Rules, line 459): but this looks like a contradiction, because the
    initial value of this variable seems to be being set in each of these
    sentences, but with a different outcome.
Inform 7 has finished.
