Problem__ PM_TableAmendmentMismatch
  >--> I'm currently trying to amend rows in 'Table 21 - Selected Elements' (source
    text, line 3) according to the instructions in 'Table 21 - Selected
    Elements (amended)' (source text, line 12). To do that, I have to match
    each amendment row in turn, which I do by trying to match up entries in the
    leftmost column(s).
    But I ran into problems:
    (Amendment 2). I can't match this to any row - there's nothing with an entry
    of '"Cheese"' (source text, line 15) in the lefthand column (Element).
    (Amendment 3). I can't decide which row this should replace. It matches 2
    rows until I get up to column 3 (Atomic number), but then it reads '31' (source
    text, line 16), which is different from either of them.
