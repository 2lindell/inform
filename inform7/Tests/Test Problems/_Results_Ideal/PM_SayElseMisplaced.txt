  >--> In the line '"A delicious ice cream cone[if the [...] ], sadly lacking a
    cherry[end if]."' (source text, line 7), I was expecting that 'else if'
    would be something to 'say', but unexpectedly I found an 'otherwise' (or
    'else'). That would be fine inside an '[if ...]' part of the text, but
    doesn't make sense on its own.
