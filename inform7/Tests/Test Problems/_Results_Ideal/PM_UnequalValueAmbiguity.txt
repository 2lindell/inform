Problem__ PM_UnequalValueAmbiguity
  >--> The phrase 'splodge dummy at the dummy for 10' (source text, line 10) is
    ambiguous in a way that I can't disentangle. It has more than one plausible
    interpretation, such that it would only be possible to tell which is valid
    at run-time: ordinarily that would be fine, but because the different
    interpretations are so different (and involve different numbers of values
    being used) there's no good way to cope. Try rewording one of the phrases
    which caused this clash: there's a good chance the problem will then go
    away.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  splodge dummy at (dummy - person) for (10 - number) 
    2.  splodge (dummy - person) at (dummy - person) for (10 - number) 
    I recognised:
    dummy = a non-temporary variable, holding a thing
    dummy = a non-temporary variable, holding a thing
