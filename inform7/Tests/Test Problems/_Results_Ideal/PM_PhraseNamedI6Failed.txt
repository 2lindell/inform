Problem__ PM_PhraseNamedI6Failed
  >--> You wrote 'To rhomb (this is the foo function)' (source text, line 2),
    defining the phrase 'rhomb' with a piece of Inform 6 code, but also giving
    it a name as a function to be used in an equation, or in some functional
    programming context. That's only allowed if the I6 definition consists
    simply of a call to an I6 function - and this doesn't, so far as I can see.
