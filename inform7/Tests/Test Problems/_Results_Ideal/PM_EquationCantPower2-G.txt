Problem__ PM_EquationCantPower2-G
  >--> In 'let T be given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law' (source text, line 15),
    you define an equation 'P = T^4': but except for the special cases of
    squaring and cubing, the '^' raise-to-power symbol can only be used to
    power a value using real rather than integer arithmetic.
Problem__ PM_LocalMismatch
  >--> You wrote 'say "[T]."' (source text, line 16), but 'T' is a temporary
    name for a value (created by 'let' or 'repeat'), whereas I was expecting to
    find a sayable value there.
Inform 7 has finished.
