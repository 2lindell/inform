  >--> You wrote 'Daphne is a person' (source text, line 1), but in another
    sentence 'The briefcase is in Daphne' (source text, line 1): Daphne cannot
    contain or support things like something inanimate, which is what you are
    implying. Instead, people must carry or wear them: so 'The briefcase is in
    Daphne.' is disallowed, but 'The briefcase is carried by Daphne.' is fine,
    or indeed 'Daphne carries the briefcase.'
