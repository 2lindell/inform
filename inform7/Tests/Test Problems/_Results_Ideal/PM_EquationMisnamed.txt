Problem__ PM_EquationMisnamed
  >--> The equation name 'Six' (source text, line 3) will have to be disallowed
    as it is text which already has a meaning to Inform. For instance, creating
    an equation called 'Equation - 2 + 2' would be disallowed because Inform
    would read '2 + 2' as arithmetic, not a name.
