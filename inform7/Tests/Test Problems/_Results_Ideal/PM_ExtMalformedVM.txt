  >--> Your source text makes use of the extension ExtMalformedVM Extension by
    Araminta Intest: but my copy stipulates that it is 'for clockwork train
    sets', which is a description of the required story file format which I
    can't understand, and should be something like '(for Z-machine version 5 or
    8 only)'.
