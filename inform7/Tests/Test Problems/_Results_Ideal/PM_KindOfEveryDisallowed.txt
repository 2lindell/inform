  >--> You wrote 'A man is never a kind of every animal' (source text, line 3):
    but you aren't allowed to make a kind of everything, or of everything
    matching a description. 'A badger is a kind of animal' is fine, but 'A gene
    is a kind of every animal' isn't allowed. (Probably you just need to get
    rid of the word 'every'.)
