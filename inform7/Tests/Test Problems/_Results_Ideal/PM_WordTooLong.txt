    Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx.
    (Individual words of unquoted text can run up to 128 letters long, which
    ought to be plenty. The longest recognised place name in the English
    speaking world is a hill in New Zealand called
    Taumatawhakatang-ihangakoauauot-amateaturipukaka-pikimaunga-horonuku-pokaiwhenuak-itanatahu.
    (You say tomato, I say taumatawhakatang-...) The longest word found in a
    classic novel is
    bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk,
    creation's thunderclap from Finnegan's Wake. And both of those words are
    fine.)
