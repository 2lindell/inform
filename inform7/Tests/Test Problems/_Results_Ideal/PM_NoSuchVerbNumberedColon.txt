Problem__ PM_NoSuchVerbNumberedColon
  >--> In the sentence 'To recite a hymn to 3: 3 be praised !' (source text, line 5),
    I can't find a verb that I know how to deal with. I notice there's a colon
    ':' with a number either side of it - this might have led to confusion
    because the usual convention that ':' divides a rule or phrase from its
    definition does not apply in this case, to avoid potential confusion with
    times of day like '2:15 PM'. If you put a line break after the ':' and
    before the second number, though, you can make sure I'm definitely reading
    it as punctuation.
Inform 7 has finished.
