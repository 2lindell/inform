  >--> You wrote '"The Palace is open" The Palace is a room' (source text, line 3):
    but it looks as if perhaps you did not intend that to read as a single
    sentence, and possibly the text in quotes was supposed to stand as as a
    sentence on its own? (The convention is that if text ends in a full stop,
    exclamation or question mark, perhaps with a close bracket or quotation
    mark involved as well, then that punctuation mark also closes the sentence
    to which the text belongs: but otherwise the words following the quoted
    text are considered part of the same sentence.)
