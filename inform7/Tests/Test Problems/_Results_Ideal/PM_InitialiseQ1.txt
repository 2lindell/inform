Problem__ PM_InitialiseQ1
  >--> The sentence 'Dawn is Sunrise' (source text, line 5) tells me that
    'Dawn', which should be a time that varies, is to have an initial value
    equal to 'Sunrise', which in turn is a time that varies. At the start of
    play, variable values have to be set equal to definite constants, so this
    is not allowed.
