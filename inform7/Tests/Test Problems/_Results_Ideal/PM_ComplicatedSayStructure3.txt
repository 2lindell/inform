  >--> In the text at '"This is Bar, the leading [one of]p [...] [or]bakery in
    the Kidlington area."' (source text, line 1), the text substitution '[one
    of]' seems to start a complicated say construction, but it doesn't have a
    matching end. (The construction I'm thinking of is '[one of] ... [or] ...
    [at random]/[purely at random]/[then at random]/[then purely at
    random]/[sticky random]/[as decreasingly likely outcomes]/[in random
    order]/[cycling]/[stopping]'.)
