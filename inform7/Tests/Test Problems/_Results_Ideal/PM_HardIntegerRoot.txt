Problem__ PM_KindRequiresGlulx
  >--> You wrote 'let x be given by x^4 = 17 where x is a number' (source text, line 4),
    but with the settings for this project as they are, I'm unable to make use
    of a real number. (Try changing to Glulx on the Settings panel; that should
    fix it.)
Problem__ PM_HardIntegerRoot
  >--> In 'let x be given by x^4 = 17 where x is a number' (source text, line 4),
    you asked me to solve the equation 'x^4 = 17', but that would have involved
    taking a tricky root of a whole number. Using real numbers that would be
    easy, but with whole numbers I'm unable to get there.
