Problem__ PM_PropertyInstance
  >--> You wrote 'The widget is a thing with printed name a container in the
    Palace' (source text, line 3): but this property value makes no sense to
    me, since it looks as if it contains a relative clause. Sometimes this
    happens if a clause follows directly on, and I have misunderstood to what
    it belongs. For instance: 'The widget is a door with matching key a thing
    in the Ballroom' is read with 'a thing in the Ballroom' as the value of the
    'matching key' property, not with 'in the Ballroom' applying to the door.
