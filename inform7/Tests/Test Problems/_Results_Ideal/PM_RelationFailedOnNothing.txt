  >--> You wrote 'Nothing is greater than the player' (source text, line 3):
    but that is an assertion which involves 'nothing', which looks as if it
    might be trying to give me negative rather than positive information.
    There's no need to tell me something like 'Nothing is in the box.': just
    don't put anything in the box, and then nothing will be in it.
Inform 7 has finished.
