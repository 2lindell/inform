Problem__ PM_RelationContradiction
  >--> I'm finding a contradiction at the sentences 'Geetha likes Indira' (source
    text, line 4) and 'Aman likes Indira' (source text, line 4), because
    between them they set up rival versions of the pairing relation (between
    people). On the one hand, Indira should relate to Geetha, but on the other
    hand to Aman, and this is a relation which doesn't allow such clashes.
