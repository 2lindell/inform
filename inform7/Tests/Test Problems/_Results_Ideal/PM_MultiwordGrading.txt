Problem__ PM_MultiwordGrading
  >--> You gave as a definition 'a thing is stately indeed if its carrying
    capacity is 6 or more' (source text, line 3): but a grading adjective must
    be a single word, as in 'Definition: a container is large if its carrying
    capacity is 10 or more.': 'fairly large' would not be allowed because it
    would make no sense to talk about 'fairly larger' or 'fairly largest'.
