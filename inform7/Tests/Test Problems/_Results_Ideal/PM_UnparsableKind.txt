  >--> The grammar token 'snippet' in the sentence 'Understand "blob [snippet]"
    as examining' (source text, line 3) invites me to understand values typed
    by the player during play but for a kind of value which is beyond my
    ability. Generally speaking, the allowable kinds of value are number, time,
    text and any new kind of value you may have created - but not, for
    instance, scene or rule.
