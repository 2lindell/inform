Problem__ PM_StartsWithComma
  >--> You wrote ', kitchen is a room' (source text, line 1): but this seems to
    refer to something whose name begins with a comma, which is forbidden.
    Perhaps you used a comma in punctuating a sentence? Inform generally
    doesn't like this because it reserves commas for specific purposes such as
    dividing rules or 'if' phrases.
