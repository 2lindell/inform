Problem__ PM_TableDefiningObject
  >--> You wrote 'The retro T-shirt are defined by the Table of Player's
    Clothing' (source text, line 9): but you can only use 'defined by' to set
    up values and things, as created with sentences like 'The tree species are
    defined by Table 1.' or 'Some men are defined by the Table of Eligible
    Bachelors.' - trying to define a single specific object, as here, is not
    allowed.
