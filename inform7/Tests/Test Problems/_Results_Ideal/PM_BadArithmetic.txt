  >--> You wrote 'let Y be 23 + "frog"' (source text, line 4), but that seems
    to involve adding a number ('23') to a text ('"frog"'), which is not good
    arithmetic.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      (23 - arithmetic value) + ("frog" - arithmetic value)

  >--> You wrote 'let X be 23 + 11:10 AM' (source text, line 5), but that seems
    to involve adding a number ('23') to a time ('11:10 AM'), which is not good
    arithmetic.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      (23 - arithmetic value) + (11:10 am - arithmetic value) 
    I recognised:
    11:10 am = a time
