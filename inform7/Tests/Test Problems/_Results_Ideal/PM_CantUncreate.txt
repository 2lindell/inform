  >--> In order to act on 'The winch switch states are lock, free, reel in, run
    out' (source text, line 3), I seem to need to give a new meaning to 'lock',
    which currently means something created by the earlier sentence 'The lock
    is scenery in the Service Area' (source text, line 2). That must be wrong,
    so I'm guessing that there is an accidental clash of names. This sometimes
    happens when adjectives are being made after objects whose names include
    them: for instance, defining 'big' as an adjective after having already
    made a 'big top'. The simplest way to avoid this is to define the
    adjectives in question first.
