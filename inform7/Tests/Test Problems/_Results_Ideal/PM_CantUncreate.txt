  >--> In order to act on 'The winch switch states are lock, free, reel in, run
    out' (source text, line 3), I seem to need to give a new meaning to 'lock',
    something which was created by the earlier sentence 'The lock is scenery in
    the Service Area' (source text, line 2). That must be wrong somehow: I'm
    guessing that there is an accidental clash of names. This sometimes happens
    when adjectives are being made after objects whose names include them: for
    instance, defining 'big' as an adjective after having already made a 'big
    top'. The simplest way to avoid this is to define the adjectives in
    question first.
