Problem__ PM_UnderstandMismatch
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "look [frog" as the statue' (source text, line 3):
    but 'understand' should be followed by text in which brackets '[' and ']'
    match, so for instance 'understand "take [something]" as taking the noun'
    is fine, but 'understand "take]" as taking' is not.
Inform 7 has finished.
