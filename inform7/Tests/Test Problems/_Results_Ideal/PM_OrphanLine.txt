Problem__ PM_OrphanLine
In Section 1 - Meeting:
  >--> You wrote 'Marcellus: "What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?"' (source
    text, line 7): but this dialogue line is indented too far, and should
    either not be indented at all, or indented by just one tab stop from the
    line it is dependent on.
Problem__ PM_OrphanLine
  >--> You wrote 'Marcellus: "Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy."' (source text, line 11):
    again, this dialogue line is indented too far.
Inform 7 has finished.
