  >--> You wrote 'The description of the power line in the Train Yard is "This
    is a power line."' (source text, line 5): but this tries to set a property
    for something more complicated than a single thing named without
    qualifications, and that isn't allowed. For instance, 'The description of
    the Great Portal is "It's open."' is fine, but 'The description of the
    Great Portal in the Palace is "It's open."' is not allowed, because it
    tries to qualify 'Great Portal' with the extra clause 'in the Palace'. (If
    you need to make a description which changes based on where something is,
    or where it is seen from, try using text substitutions.)
