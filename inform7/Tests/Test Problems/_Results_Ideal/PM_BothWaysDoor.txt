Problem__ PM_BothWaysDoor
  >--> The Drawbridge seems to be a door whose connections have been given in
    both of the alternative ways at once, by directly giving its map
    connections (the normal way to set up a two-sided door) and also by saying
    what is through it (the normal way to set up a one-sided door). As a door
    can't be both one- and two-sided at once, I'm going to object to this.
