  >--> You wrote 'The piano is a thing' (source text, line 1), but in another
    sentence 'East of the Conservatoire is the piano' (source text, line 1):
    piano appears to be something which can be reached via a map connection,
    but it seems to be neither a room nor a door, and these are the only
    possibilities allowed by Inform.
