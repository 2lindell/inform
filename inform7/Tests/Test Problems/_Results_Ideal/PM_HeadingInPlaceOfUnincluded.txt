Problem__ PM_HeadingInPlaceOfUnincluded
  >--> In the sentence 'Section of Minimal Grammar (in place of Section SR4/10
    - Grammar in Missing Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 3), it
    looks as if you intend to replace a section of source text from the
    extension 'Missing Rules by Graham Nelson', but no extension of that name
    has been included - so it is not possible to replace any of its headings.
