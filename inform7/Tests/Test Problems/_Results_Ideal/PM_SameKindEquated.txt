  >--> The sentence 'The dark door is a door' (source text, line 3) seems to be
    telling me that two descriptions, both forms of door, are the same. That's
    a little puzzling - like saying that 'An open container is a container.'
    Sometimes this happens because I've read too much into a name - for
    instance, 'A dark room is a room' makes me read 'dark room' as 'dark' (an
    adjective I know) plus 'room', but maybe the writer actually meant a
    photographer's workshop. If you need to call something by a name which
    confuses me, one way is to use 'called': for instance, 'West is a room
    called the dark room.' Another way is to call it something else here, and
    set the 'printed name' property to what you want the player to see - for
    instance, 'The photo lab is a room. The printed name of the photo lab is
    "dark room".'
