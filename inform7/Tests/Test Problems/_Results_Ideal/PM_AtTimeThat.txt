Problem__ PM_AtTimeThat
  >--> You wrote 'At the time that the master arrives' (source text, line 2):
    but this seems to use 'that' where it should use 'when', assuming it's
    trying to apply a rule to an event. (The convention is that any rule
    beginning 'At' is a timed one. The time can either be a fixed time, as in
    'At 11:10 AM: ...', or the time when some named event takes place, as in
    'At the time when the clock chimes: ...'.)
