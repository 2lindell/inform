Problem__ PM_BadRulePreamble
  >--> You wrote 'Arfle barfle gloop' (source text, line 3): but the
    punctuation here ':' makes me think this should be a definition of a phrase
    and it doesn't begin as it should, with either 'To' (e.g. 'To flood the
    riverplain:'), 'Definition:', a name for a rule (e.g. 'This is the
    devilishly cunning rule:'), 'At' plus a time (e.g. 'At 11:12 PM:' or 'At
    the time when the clock chimes') or the name of a rulebook, possibly
    followed by some description of the action or value to apply to (e.g.
    'Instead of taking something:' or 'Every turn:').
