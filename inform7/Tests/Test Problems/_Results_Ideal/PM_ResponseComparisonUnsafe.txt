  >--> You wrote 'if the banana split rule response (A) is "fishy"' (source
    text, line 4): but for complicated internal reasons this comparison isn't
    safe to perform, and might give you a falsely negative result. To avoid
    what might be misleading, you aren't allowed to compare a response to text.
