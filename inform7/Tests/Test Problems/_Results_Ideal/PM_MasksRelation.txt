    'To decide whether (X - testval) is beyond (Y - testval)' (source text, line 7)
    because it could be misunderstood. There is already a definition of what it
    means for something to be 'beyond' something else, so this phrase

    verb to be beyond means the containment relation' (source text, line 5).)
