  >--> You wrote 'now all scenes (called Fred) are recurring' (source text, line 4):
    but a 'now' is not allowed to call names, and it wouldn't really make sense
    to do so anyway. 'if a person (called the victim) is in the Trap Room'
    makes sense, because it gives a name - 'victim' - to someone whose identity
    we don't know. But 'now a person (called the victim) is in the Trap Room'
    won't be allowed, because 'now' can only talk about people or things whose
    identities we do know.
