Problem__ PM_EquationDimensionPower
  >--> In 'Equation 1 Q = I^n where Q is an electric charge, I is an electric
    current, n is a number' (source text, line 11), you define an equation 'Q =
    I^n': but the '^' raise-to-power symbol can only be used to raise a value
    with dimensions to a specific number. So 'mv^2' is fine, but not 'mv^n' or
    'mv^(1+n)'. (This is because I would need to work out what kind of value
    'v^n' would be, and the answer would depend on 'n', but I wouldn't know
    what 'n' is.)
