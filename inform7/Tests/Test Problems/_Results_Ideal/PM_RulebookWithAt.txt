Problem__ PM_RulebookWithAt
  >--> You wrote 'At the end of time is a rulebook' (source text, line 3): but
    this would create a rulebook whose name begins with 'at', which is
    forbidden since it would lead to ambiguities in the way people write rules.
    A rule beginning with 'At' is one which happens at a given time, whereas a
    rule belonging to a rulebook starts with the name of that rulebook, so a
    rulebook named 'at ...' would make such a rule inscrutable.
