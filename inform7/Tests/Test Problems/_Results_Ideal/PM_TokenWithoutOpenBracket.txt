Problem__ PM_TokenWithoutOpenBracket
  >--> You wrote 'To shoot N - a number) wombles' (source text, line 3): but a
    close bracket ')' appears here with no matching open '(', so I can't see
    what is meant to be the fixed text and what is meant to be changeable. The
    idea is to put brackets around whatever varies from one usage to another:
    for instance, 'To contribute (N - a number) dollars: ...'.
