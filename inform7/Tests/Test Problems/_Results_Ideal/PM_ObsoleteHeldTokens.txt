  >--> In the sentence 'Understand "button [something held]" as taking' (source
    text, line 3), you used the '[something held]' as a token, which was
    allowed in the early Public Beta versions of Inform 7, but became out of
    date in August 2006. A change was then made so that if an action needed to
    apply to something which was carried, this would now be specified when the
    action is created - not in the Understand line for it. For instance, one
    might say 'Dismantling is an action which applies to one carried thing',
    instead of '...which applies to one thing', and then write grammar such as
    'Understand "dismantle [something] as dismantling' instead of
    '...[something held]...'. So you probably need to change your '[something
    held]' token to '[something]', and change the action's definition (unless
    it is a built-in action such as 'dropping'). An alternative, though, for
    fine-tuning is to change it to '[something preferably held]', which allows
    anything to be Understood, but in cases of ambiguity tends to guess that
    something held is more likely to be what the player means than something
    not held.
