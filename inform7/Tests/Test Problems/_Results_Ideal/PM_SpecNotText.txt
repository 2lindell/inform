Problem__ PM_SpecNotText
  >--> You wrote 'The specification of volcano cup size is 10' (source text, line 5):
    but this tries to set a specification to something other than literal
    quoted text, which will not work. 'Specification' is a special property
    used only to annotate the Index, and specifically the Kinds index, so it
    makes no sense to set this property to anything other than text.
