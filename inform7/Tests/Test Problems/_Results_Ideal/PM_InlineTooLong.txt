Problem__ PM_InlineTooLong
  >--> You wrote 'To exceed reasonable limits' (source text, line 3): but the
    inline definition of this 'to...' phrase is too long, using a quantity of
    Inform 6 code which exceeds the fairly small limit allowed. You will need
    either to write the phrase definition in Inform 7, or to call an I6 routine
    which you define elsewhere with an 'Include ...'.
