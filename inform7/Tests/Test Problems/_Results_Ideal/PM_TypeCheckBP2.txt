  >--> In the sentence 'if the player's command contains "anything"' (source
    text, line 4), it looks as if you intend 'player's command contains
    "anything"' to be a condition, but that would mean applying the containment
    relation (between objects) to kinds of value which do not fit - a text and
    an object - so this must be incorrect.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      if (player's command contains "anything" - a condition): 
    I recognised:
    player's command contains "anything" = a condition
