Problem__ PM_ImplicationCertain
  >--> You wrote 'A gold thing is always blue' (source text, line 5): but
    that's an implication which is too certain for me, since a sentence like
    this talks about a generality of things in terms of one either/or property
    implying another, and I can only handle those as likelihoods. You should
    probably add 'usually' somewhere: e.g., 'An open door is usually openable'.
    (But implications can have unpredictable consequences: best to avoid them
    altogether where possible.)
