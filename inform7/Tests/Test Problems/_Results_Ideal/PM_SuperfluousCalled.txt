Problem__ PM_KindAsProperty
  >--> You wrote ''Theme is a kind of value' (source text, line 3)', but that
    seems to say that a property ('theme' (source text, line 5)) has to be a
    kind as well. It is sometimes okay for a property to have the same name as
    a kind, but only when that kind is what it stores, and there shouldn't be a
    sentence like this one to declare the kind - it will be made when the
    property is made, and doesn't need to be made again.
Problem__ PM_SuperfluousCalled
  >--> You wrote 'Movie has a theme called theme' (source text, line 5): but
    'called' should be used only when the name is different from the kind, so
    this sentence should be simplified. For example, 'A door has a colour
    called colour' should be written more simply as 'A door has a colour'; but
    'called' can be used for something like 'A door has a number called the
    street number'.
