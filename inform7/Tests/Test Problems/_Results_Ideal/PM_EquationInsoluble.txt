Problem__ PM_Unknown
  >--> In the sentence 'decide on N+7' (source text, line 5), I was expecting
    to read a value, but instead found some text that I couldn't understand -
    'N+7'.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      decide on (n+7 - value) 
    But I didn't recognise 'n+7'.
Problem__ PM_EquationInsoluble
  >--> In 'let F be given by m = wibble F' (source text, line 10), you asked to
    let F be given by the equation 'm = wibble F', but I am unable to rearrange
    the equation in any simple way so that it sets 'F' equal to something else.
    Maybe you could write a more explicit equation? (You're certainly better at
    maths than I am; I can only make easy deductions.)
Inform 7 has finished.
