  >--> In 'let F be given by m = wibble F' (source text, line 10), you asked to
    let F be given by the equation 'm = wibble F', but I am unable to rearrange
    the equation in any simple way so that it sets 'F' equal to something else.
    Maybe you could write a more explicit equation? (You're certainly better at
    maths than I am; I can only make easy deductions.)
