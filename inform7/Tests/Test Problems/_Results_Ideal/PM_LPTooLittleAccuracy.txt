Problem__ PM_LPTooLittleAccuracy
  >--> In the sentence 'let X be 0.004kg' (source text, line 8), you use the
    notation '0.004kg' to write a constant value. But to store that, I would
    need greater accuracy than this kind of value has - see the Kinds page of
    the Index for the range it has.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (x - a new name) be (0.004kg - description of relations of
    values) 
    2.  let (x - a new name) be (0.004kg - name of kind) 
    3.  let (x - a new name) be (0.004kg - value) 
    4.  let (x - a temporary named value) be (0.004kg - value) 
    But I didn't recognise '0.004kg'.
    The name 'x' doesn't yet exist.
