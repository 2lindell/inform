  >--> In the text at '"This is Boz, the [if 1 is 2]leadin [...] at random] in
    the Kidlington area."' (source text, line 1), the '[end if]' is cut off
    from its [if ...], because it has been interleaved with a complicated say
    construction. (The construction I'm thinking of is '[one of] ... [or] ...
    [at random]/[purely at random]/[then at random]/[then purely at
    random]/[sticky random]/[as decreasingly likely outcomes]/[in random
    order]/[cycling]/[stopping]'.)
