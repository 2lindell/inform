Problem__ PM_DuplicateHere
  >--> You wrote 'A chair is here' (source text, line 2), but in another
    sentence 'A chair is here' (source text, line 4): chair can only be said to
    be 'here' once, in a single assertion sentence. This avoids potential
    confusion, since 'here' can mean different things in different sentences.
Problem__ PM_Contradiction
  >--> You wrote 'A chair is here' (source text, line 4), but in another
    sentence 'A chair is here' (source text, line 2): but this looks like a
    contradiction, which might be because I have misunderstood what was meant
    to be the subject of one or both of those sentences.
Inform 7 has finished.
