Problem__ PM_EquationEquatesBadly
  >--> In 'Equation 2 m (F = a) where F is a number, m is a number, a is a
    number' (source text, line 3), you define an equation 'm (F = a)': but the
    equals sign '=' here seems to be buried inside the formula, not at the
    surface. For instance, 'F = ma' is fine, but 'F(m=a)' would not make sense
    - the '=' would be inside brackets.
