Problem__ PM_ActionAlreadyExists
  >--> You wrote 'Taking is an action applying to two things' (source text, line 3):
    but that seems to be an action already existing, so it cannot be redefined
    now. If you would like to reconfigure an action in the standard set - for
    instance if you prefer 'unlocking' to apply to only one thing, not two -
    create a new action for what you need ('keyless unlocking', perhaps) and
    then change the grammar to use the new action rather than the old
    ('Understand "unlock [something]" as keyless unlocking.').
