  >--> You wrote 'A scene has a number that varies called the difficulty
    rating' (source text, line 3), which I am reading as a request to make a
    new named property - a value associated with an object and which has a
    name. But you write this as if it were a variable, which is not allowed
    because it would confuse things. For example, 'A scene has a number that
    varies called the completion bonus.' is not allowed - it should just be 'A
    scene has a number called the completion bonus.', that is, without the
    'that varies'.
