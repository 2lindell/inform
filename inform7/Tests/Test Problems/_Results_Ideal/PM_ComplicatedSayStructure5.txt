  >--> In the text at '"This is Mab, the [if 1 is 2]leadin [...] at random] in
    the Kidlington area."' (source text, line 1), the '[otherwise]' ought to
    occur inside an [if ...], but is cut off because it has been interleaved
    with a complicated say construction. (The construction I'm thinking of is
    '[one of] ... [or] ... [at random]/[purely at random]/[then at
    random]/[then purely at random]/[sticky random]/[as decreasingly likely
    outcomes]/[in random order]/[cycling]/[stopping]'.)
