Problem__ PM_TokenWithoutCloseBracket
  >--> You wrote 'To shoot (N - a number wombles' (source text, line 3): but
    the opening bracket '(' has no matching close bracket ')', so I can't see
    what is meant to be the fixed text and what is meant to be changeable. The
    idea is to put brackets around whatever varies from one usage to another:
    for instance, 'To contribute (N - a number) dollars: ...'.
