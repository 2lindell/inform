Problem__ PM_NonActionInPresenceOf
  >--> You wrote 'Every turn in the presence of Mme Cholet' (source text, line 3),
    but 'in the presence of...' is a clause which can only be used to talk
    about an action: so, for instance, 'waiting in the presence of...' is
    needed. This problem arises especially with 'every turn' rules, where
    'every turn in the presence of...' looks plausible but doesn't work. This
    could be fixed by writing 'Every turn doing something in the presence
    of...', but a neater solution talks about the current situation instead:
    'Every turn when the player can see...'.
