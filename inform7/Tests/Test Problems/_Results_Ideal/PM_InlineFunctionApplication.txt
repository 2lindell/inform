Problem__ PM_InlineFunctionApplication
  >--> You wrote 'go awry 21' (source text, line 8), which I read as making use
    of the phrase 'To go awry (N - a number)' (source text, line 3). This in
    turn has what's called an 'inline' definition, written in a technical
    notation usually needed only by the Standard Rules or other low-level
    extensions. The definition here is
    '{-primitive-definition:function-application};' but it seems to be broken.
    A function application only makes sense if the first token, '21', is a
    phrase: here it isn't.
