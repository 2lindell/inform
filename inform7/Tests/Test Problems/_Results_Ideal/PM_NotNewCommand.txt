Problem__ PM_NotNewCommand
  >--> You wrote 'Understand the command "take" as "drop"' (source text, line 3):
    but 'understand the command ... as ...' is only allowed when the new
    command has no meaning already, so for instance 'understand "drop" as
    "throw"' is not allowed because "drop" already has a meaning.
