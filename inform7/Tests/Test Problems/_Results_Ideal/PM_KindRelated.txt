  >--> You wrote 'A door is in the Hall of Infinity' (source text, line 1): but
    something described only by its kind should not be given a specific place
    or role in the world, to avoid ambiguity. For instance, suppose 'car' is a
    kind. Then we are not allowed to say 'a car is in the garage': there's too
    much risk of confusion between whether an individual (but nameless) car is
    referred to, or whether cars are generically to be found there. Sentences
    of this form are therefore prohibited, though more specific ones like 'a
    car called Genevieve is in the garage' are fine, as is the reverse, 'In the
    garage is a car.'
