  >--> In the sentence 'award arfle barfle gloop points' (source text, line 7),
    I was expecting to read a number, but instead found some text that I
    couldn't understand - 'arfle barfle gloop'.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      award (arfle barfle gloop - number) points 
    But I didn't recognise 'arfle barfle gloop'.
