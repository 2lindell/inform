Problem__ PM_NameWithBrackets
  >--> The sentence 'Ballroom (East Corner) is a room' (source text, line 1)
    seems to give something the name 'Ballroom (East Corner)', but that name
    contains brackets '(' or ')', which is not allowed since the potential for
    confusion with other uses for brackets in Inform source text is too high.
    (If you need, say, a room which the player sees as 'Fillmore (West)', you
    can get this effect with: 'Fillmore West is a room with printed name
    "Fillmore (West)".')
Inform 7 has finished.
