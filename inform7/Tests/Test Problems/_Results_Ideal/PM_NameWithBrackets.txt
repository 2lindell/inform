Problem__ PM_NameWithBrackets
  >--> You wrote 'Ballroom (East Corner) is a room' (source text, line 1): but
    this seems to give something a name which contains brackets '(' or ')',
    which is not allowed since the potential for confusion with other uses for
    brackets in Inform source text is too high. (If you need, say, a room which
    the player sees as 'Fillmore (West)', you can get this effect with:
    'Fillmore West is a room with printed name "Fillmore (West)".')
