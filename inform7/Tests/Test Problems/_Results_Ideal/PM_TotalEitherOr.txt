Problem__ PM_TotalEitherOr
  >--> You wrote 'let N be the total transparent of the men' (source text, line 4):
    but this seems to be an attempt to total up an either/or property, and by
    definition such a property has nothing to total.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      total (transparent - arithmetic values valued property) of (men - description
    of values) 
    I recognised:
    transparent = an either/or property
    men = a description of men
