  >--> You wrote 'now action requires a carried noun' (source text, line 5),
    but although 'action requires a carried noun' is a condition which it is
    legal to test with 'if', 'when', and so forth, it is not something I can
    arrange to happen on request. Whether it is true or not depends on current
    circumstances: so to make it true, you will need to adjust those
    circumstances.
