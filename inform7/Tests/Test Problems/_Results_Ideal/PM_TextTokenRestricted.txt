Problem__ PM_TextTokenRestricted
  >--> You wrote 'if the player's command matches "frog [text]"' (source text, line 3):
    but the '[text]' token is not allowed with 'matches' or in table columns,
    as it is just too complicated to sort out: a '[text]' is supposed to
    extract a snippet from the player's command, but here we already have a
    snippet, and don't want to snip it further.
