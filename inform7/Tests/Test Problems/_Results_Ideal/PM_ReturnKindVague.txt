  >--> The declaration 'To decide which value is froggg' (source text, line 2)
    tries to set up a phrase which decides a value which is too vaguely
    described. For example, 'To decide which number is the target: ...' is
    fine, because 'number' is clear about what kind of value should emerge; but
    'To decide which value is the target: ...' is not clear enough.
