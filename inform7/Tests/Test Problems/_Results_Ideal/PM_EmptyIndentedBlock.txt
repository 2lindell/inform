  >--> The phrase or rule definition 'When play begins' (source text, line 3)
    is written using the 'colon and indentation' syntax for its 'if's,
    'repeat's and 'while's, where blocks of phrases grouped together are
    indented one tab step inward from the 'if ...:' or similar phrase to which
    they belong. But the phrase 'if 1 is 2' (source text, line 4), which ought
    to begin a block, is immediately followed by 'say "1 is 2"' (source text, line 5)
    at the same or a lower indentation, so the block seems to be empty - this
    must mean there has been a mistake in indenting the phrases.
