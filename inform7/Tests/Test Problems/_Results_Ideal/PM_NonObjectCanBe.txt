  >--> You wrote 'Dropping can be fun or tiresome' (source text, line 1): but
    only a room, a thing or a kind can have such adjectives applied to it, so
    that 'a dead end can be secret' is fine but 'taking can be secret' would
    not be, since 'taking' is an action and not a room, thing or kind.
