In Part Three - Variables and Rulebooks, Chapter 1 - Variables, Section 1 -
  Situation in the extension Standard Rules by Graham Nelson:
  >--> The name 'Table of Vessels' (source text, line 3) will have to be
    disallowed because 'Vessels' is also the name of a kind, or of the plural
    of a kind. (For instance, writing 'Table of Rooms' is disallowed - it could
    lead to great confusion.)
