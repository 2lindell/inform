Problem__ PM_InlineMatchesDescription
  >--> You wrote 'go awry' (source text, line 8), which I read as making use of
    the phrase 'To go awry' (source text, line 3). This in turn has what's
    called an 'inline' definition, written in a technical notation usually
    needed only by the Standard Rules or other low-level extensions. The
    definition here is '{-matches-description:frog:amphibian};' but it seems to
    be broken. The command {-matches-description:...}, which asks to test
    whether 'amphibian' is a valid description for 'frog', has gone wrong: I
    couldn't work those out.
