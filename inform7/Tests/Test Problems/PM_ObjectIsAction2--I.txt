Problem__ PM_ObjectIsAction2
  >--> You wrote 'Zog is initially examining yourself' (source text, line 2):
    but you need to add 'the action of' after 'initially', in order to clarify
    that you mean this sentence to set a variable to an action (if in fact
    that's what you mean to do!).
Inform 7 has finished.
