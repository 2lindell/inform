Problem__ PM_ScenesWithTooManyEnds
  >--> You wrote 'Frogmarch ends in manner 14 when the player is in Danger
    Zone' (source text, line 20): but this scene now has too many different
    ways to end, and will need to be simplified. (We can have up to 15 ends to
    a scene if the project format is for the Z-machine, and 31 for Glulx: see
    the project's Settings panel. Note that the ordinary 'begins' and 'ends'
    count as two of those, so you can only name up to 13 or 29 more specific
    ways for the scene to end.)
