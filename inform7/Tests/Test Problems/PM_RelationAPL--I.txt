  >--> The sentence 'A room in Oliver's House is usually indoor' (source text, line 3)
    looked to me as if it might be trying to assign certain properties to
    something described in a way (a description of rooms) which involved a
    clause which can't be properly determined until the game is running, so
    that at this point it's impossible to act upon.
