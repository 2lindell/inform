Problem__ PM_InexplicitTableEntryAsValue
  >--> You wrote 'Act I begins when the player's command includes a topic
    listed in table 1' (source text, line 3): but this form of table entry can
    only be used in certain special phrases, because it doesn't explicitly
    refer to a single value. (You can see which phrases in the Phrasebook
    index: it's allowed wherever a 'table entry' is wanted.)
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      (player's command - snippet) includes (a topic listed in table 1 - topic)
    
    I recognised:
    player's command = a non-temporary variable, holding a snippet
    a topic listed in table 1 = a table entry, holding a topic
