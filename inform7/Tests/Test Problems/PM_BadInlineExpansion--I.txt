  >--> You wrote 'blow up' (source text, line 6), but when I looked that phrase
    up I found that its inline definition included the bracing {utter drivel}.
    Text written in braces like this, in an inline phrase definition, should be
    one of the following: a name of one of the tokens in the phrase, or a
    phrase option, or the text 'phrase options' itself. The ability to write
    inline phrases is really intended only for the Standard Rules and a few
    other low-level system extensions. A good rule of thumb is: if you can
    define a phrase without using I6 insertions, do.
