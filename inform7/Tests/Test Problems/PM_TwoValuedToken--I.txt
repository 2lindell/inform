Problem__ PM_TwoValuedToken
  >--> You wrote 'Understand "button [a number] on [something]" as "[button
    indication]"' (source text, line 3): but there can be at most one varying
    part in the definition of a named token, so 'Understand "button [a number]"
    as "[button indication]"' is allowed but 'Understand "button [a number] on
    [something]" as "[button indication]"' is not.
Inform 7 has finished.
