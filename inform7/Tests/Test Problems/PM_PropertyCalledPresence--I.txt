Problem__ PM_PropertyCalledPresence
  >--> You wrote 'A person has a text called presence' (source text, line 1):
    but a property name cannot consist only of the word 'presence', because
    this would lead to ambiguities with the rule clause '...in the presence
    of...' (For instance, when writing something like 'Instead of eating in the
    presence of the Queen: ...') The best way to fix this is probably to add
    another word or two to the property name: 'stage presence', say, would be
    fine.
