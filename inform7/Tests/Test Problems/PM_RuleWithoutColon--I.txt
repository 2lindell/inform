Problem__ PM_RuleWithoutColon
  >--> You wrote 'Before taking something' (source text, line 1): but I can't
    find a verb that I know how to deal with, so can't do anything with this
    sentence. It looks as if it might be a rule definition, but if so then it
    is lacking the necessary colon (or comma). The punctuation style for rules
    is 'Rule conditions: do this; do that; do some more.' Perhaps you used a
    full stop instead of the colon?
