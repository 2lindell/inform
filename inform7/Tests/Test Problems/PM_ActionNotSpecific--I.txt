  >--> You wrote 'try taking something' (source text, line 4), but 'taking
    something' is too vague to describe a specific action. It has to be an
    exact instruction about what is being done, and to what. For instance,
    'taking the box' is fine, but 'dropping or taking something openable' is
    not.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      try (taking something - action) 
    I recognised:
    taking something = a described action
