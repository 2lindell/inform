  >--> You wrote 'if we have examined the grail for the fifth time' (source
    text, line 5): but a condition like 'we have X', where X is an action, has
    either happened for one spell or never happened at all, so it can't make
    sense to ask if it has happened two or more times. For instance, at the
    start of play 'we have jumped' is false, but once the player types JUMP,
    'we have jumped' will then be true for the rest of time. 'We have jumped
    for the second time' doesn't mean the jumping happened twice, it means the
    having-jumped has happened twice, which is impossible.
