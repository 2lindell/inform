  >--> You wrote 'Carelessness is dropping something' (source text, line 1):
    but that is putting the definition back to front, since I need these
    categorisations of actions to take the form 'Kissing a woman is love', not
    'Love is kissing a woman'. (This is really because it is better style: love
    might be many other things too, and we don't want to imply that the present
    definition is all-inclusive.)
