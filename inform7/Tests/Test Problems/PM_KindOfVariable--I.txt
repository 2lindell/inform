  >--> In the sentence 'prognosticate about splodge splodge' (source text, line 6),
    I was expecting that 'splodge splodge' would be a new variable name (to
    hold a number), but it turned out to be a rulebook.
    I was trying to match this phrase:
      prognosticate about (splodge splodge - a new name) 
    I recognised:
    splodge splodge = a rulebook
