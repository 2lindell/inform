Problem__ PM_OverComplexToken
  >--> The grammar you give in 'Understand "blob [something which can see the
    player]" as examining' (source text, line 3) contains a token which is just
    too complicated - something which can see the player. For instance, a
    token using subordinate clauses - such as '[a person who can see the
    player]' will probably not be allowed.
Inform 7 has finished.
