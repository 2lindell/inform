To begin:
	call C collatz function with 17.

To run the Collatz algorithm on (N - a number):
	say "MRS I: I have heard Mr C tell that [N] is an interesting number. ";
	if N is 1:
		say "And so I triumph!";
	else:
		if N is even:
			say "And so I halve.";
			call C collatz function with N divided by two;
		else:
			say "And so I treble and add 1.";
			call C collatz function with ( N times 3 plus 1).

To call C collatz function with (N - a number):
	(- external__collatz({N}); -).
