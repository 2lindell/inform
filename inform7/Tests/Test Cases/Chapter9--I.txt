  Early Afternoon
  The waxing crescent moon is in the sky just overhead.
  
  There is a vast bowl of sand, almost a miniature desert; the bowl is black stone on columns. From the center of the bowl a thin trickle of sand runs into a heap on the ground. The height of the heap tells you that it is now twenty to eleven.
