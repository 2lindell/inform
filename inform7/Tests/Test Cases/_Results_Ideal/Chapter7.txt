  Linda's Bunkhouse
  NO WEARING BOOTS IN HOUSE -- LOVE, BLACK PETE, says a sign on the wall.
  
  You can also see a stack of discarded boots and a stool here.

  You have the prickly sense of being watched...
  
  It is hand-written in black pen and there is attached a polaroid of Black Pete: he is large, he is bearded, he is smiling in a manner which discourages conversation. He is caucasian, so apparently the epithet is piratical.

  Lounge
  The largest and most comfortable room in the Bunkhouse, the lounge offers two shabby sofas and a telephone (card required for long-distance calls, and everything is long-distance here).
  
  The television is, atypically, off.
  
  Jim is relaxing in a corner.
  
  You can also see a bedroom door, a pyramid of empty beer bottles and a sofa here.

  Jim grins at you salaciously, in a way which makes you suddenly less eager to ask him for favors.

  The bedroom door creaks a little but turns out to be just fine. Something tells you, though, that this place is not the sturdiest construction ever.
  
  Lounge
  The largest and most comfortable room in the Bunkhouse, the lounge offers two shabby sofas and a telephone (card required for long-distance calls, and everything is long-distance here).
  
  A television cheerfully displays the local news in Denver, genuinely local news being a contradiction in terms here.
  
  Jim is relaxing in a corner.

  Gravelly Parking Lot
  A lot of grey gravel and grey dirt. Off to the west is the Fish Packing Plant; south, the ground slopes down to beach. A thin strip of land, mostly taken up with road, runs north toward the rest of the island.
  
  Black Pete is standing at the edge of the parking lot, looking towards the sea.

  Beach (in the grubby pickup truck)

  You can see a wheelbarrow (empty) here.

  Narrow Spit (in the grubby pickup truck)
  A strip of land barely wider than the road, with water on either side. The views in all directions are fog, water, and the curiously soft curves of the land, carpeted in a bright green but devoid of trees.
  
  Down to the west is the small boat harbor.
  
  You can see a staircase and a pogo stick (empty) here.

  Bridge (in the grubby pickup truck)
  A bridge connects Dutch Harbor proper to the south with Unalaska to the north. There isn't much to tell between them, except that Dutch Harbor is more industrial and contains the airport, whereas people actually have houses in Unalaska.
  
  In the lee of the land, down near the water's edge, a stunted and apologetic sitka spruce has managed to grow. It is one of perhaps three trees on the entire island.

  A recently-built and reasonably attractive single-room library, with a selection mostly of popular fiction, but also free internet access at a couple of elderly PCs.
  
  Janet is the librarian, and mistress of all she surveys -- namely, one of the cleanest, driest, and quietest locations in a radius of several hundred miles.

  Russian Orthodox Church
  Built in the eighteenth century, it looks distinctly out of place now, with its small green onion-domes and handsome white walls. The graveyard is full of almost illegible markers in cyrillic writing.
  
  Down the road to the north is the Elbow Room bar.

  Elbow Room
  Reputed to be the most dangerous bar in the United States; from the outside what it looks like is a virulently purple shack, and from the inside like a badly-lit one. No one is having a knife fight at the moment.
  
  On the bar are a glass bowl (in which is a selection of pull-tabs) and a shot glass.

  Family Restaurant
  The Family Restaurant serves, impartially, all of the following: inferior hamburgers; inferior fish and chips; inferior spaghetti; inferior Chinese food; inferior sushi. Some nights it is open until its posted time of three am, and some nights the owner is overwhelmed with ennui and shuts down at 9:30.
  
  The only constant about the Family Restaurant is the garnish on every plate, of half a maraschino cherry, a thick slice of orange, and a bush-sized quantity of parsley.

That's all right, though -- you heard enough stirring tales about life on the job last night. New hires apparently have an unnerving habit of dropping dead of heart-attack, and things like that.

  Grand Aleutian Hotel
  Called the Grand Illusion by natives and people who actually do work in Dutch Harbor, the Grand Aleutian is the swank hotel used by sport fishers and birdwatchers. Among the amenities are an overpriced restaurant and a similarly excessive cafe.

  Museum of the Aleutians
  A subdued and tasteful museum with gentle lighting. The holdings are not large, but they are interesting: examples of native crafts (heavy on basket-weaving, since there isn't much by way of clay or wood around here); photographs dating back to the 1930s; and memorabilia of World War II, when this was briefly conquered by the enemy, the only piece of the United States to be lost to the Japanese.

  Not being an employer of fish packers, you are not permitted in the fish packing plant, and from the outside there's not much to see other than a bunch of metal-sided sheds. That's all right, though -- you heard enough stirring tales about life on the job last night. New hires apparently have an unnerving habit of dropping dead of heart-attack, and things like that.
