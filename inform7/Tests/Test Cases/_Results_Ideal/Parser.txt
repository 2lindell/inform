  Schloss Parserhof
  Begun by Mad King Ludwig in 1878, this grand foyer was projected to be the antechamber to a long series of exotic chambers in which the Austrian monarch could have parser antics performed before his eyes. Build on a north-south spinal passage, it has been found monotonous by some architectural critics.
