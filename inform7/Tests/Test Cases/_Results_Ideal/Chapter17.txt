  There's something wrong with it. Something wrong not just in the way it looks, but in the fact of its existence at all. It both frightens and offends.

  Bronzino Interior
  The first thing you notice is how little room there is in here. You're pushed right out at the edge, near the frame. There's not so much light where you are. It's hard not to resent those careless happy figures in the center when you're pushed back here in obscurity, elbow to elbow with...
  
  Yes. It's not an illusion. The girl's body does taper off into a snake. Though she's smiling, though she's not looking at you, you know she knows you're staring and she hates you for it.
  
  You redirect your attention to more pleasant things. The shining ball in the hand of Venus. The mask on the floor. Cupid's ruddy cheek, smoother than mortal flesh could be.
  
  Sketched on the flooris a mask.

  ** touch girl
  She doesn't look at you, but her mind touches yours, and it is an experience you would prefer not to repeat. All the things you have done and regretted, all the petty cruelties, all the embarrassing moments driven by an ill-considered desire come back in a tide of chagrin.

  ** x cupid
  He has all his mother's attention. In fact, there's something a little incestuous about his hand on her breast. Or is that just infant innocence? It's hard to make sense of gestures in the usual way because, after all, these people aren't people but constructs.

  Bronzino Interior
  The first thing you notice is how little room there is in here. You're pushed right out at the edge, near the frame. There's not so much light where you are. It's hard not to resent those careless happy figures in the center when you're pushed back here in obscurity, elbow to elbow with...
  
  Yes. It's not an illusion. The girl's body does taper off into a snake. Though she's smiling, though she's not looking at you, you know she knows you're staring and she hates you for it.
  
  You redirect your attention to more pleasant things. The shining ball in the hand of Venus. Cupid's ruddy cheek, smoother than mortal flesh could be.
  
  Sketched on the floorare a platter supporting the ginger ale and a dangerous corkscrew.

  Holbein Interior
  You're on display. "Look at me, look at my goods." That's what the other two are thinking, anyway.  You don't know whether you come out as well as they do: prosperous, successful, men of power and the world.
  
  There's something at your feet, obscuring the neat pattern of the rug. A grey-brown blur that won't resolve into a shape no matter how you stare at it. Looking at it makes your stomach go askew.
