  Striped Tent
  Dusty light, filtered into alternating bars of red and yellow; sand and straw on the ground failing to entirely soak up the leavings from the performing animals; rows of flimsy benches without spectators.
  
  Bobo is hanging from one of the supports. He gives you a look of consternation.
  
  The Circus is too poor, or perhaps too nervous, to own a real lion. Instead it possesses a robot.
  
  The Living Rug is lying around in a funk. It resembles a bearskin rug, but is in fact a freak of natur-- oh, well, that's just what you tell the guests. It's a big fur costume which someone puts on and walks around in.
  
  The Visible Sheep is a purchase from an agricultural college. A door in the side of the sheep opens to reveal (through glass) all the sheep organs doing their assorted business.
  
  You can also see a mother kangaroo, an elephant and a glass door here.
