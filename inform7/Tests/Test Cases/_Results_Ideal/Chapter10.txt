> >   Kitchen
  ** x chicken
  (the flattened chicken breast)
  It has been hammered to a thickness of about a half inch. (The recipe said a quarter inch but you're pretty sure it was joking. You have never been able to achieve a quarter inch.)

  ** x thurston
  A Washington State Pinot Gris-Viognier, vintage 2003. It is said to have "peach aromas", and, startlingly, the untutored person can actually detect these without resorting to fantasy.
  
  (It is also supposed to possess a delicate perfume and a moderate body; the label author at least stopped short of adding "and a good sense of humor").
