  Vehicle Testing Center
  A large square of field surrounded by a wall of hay bales. There's a driveway that leads out to the west.
  
  The ground slopes down to a pond along the northern edge.
  
  The sign advertises experimental rides in the following: a red wagon, a glass elevator, a swan and a Harley.
  
  There is a lovely red wagon here, complete with an outboard motor.
  
  A glass elevator stands in the center, a fantastically strong microfilament connecting it to... something in the sky.
  
  At the pond's edge waits a black swan of unusual size, wearing a bridle and a gold-trimmed Mexican hat.

  Pond (on the swan)
  Funny, the pond is bigger from the middle than it seemed from the shore. In fact, you can't see any edge but the testing center to the south.
