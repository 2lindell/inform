  Assembled with a cheerful eclecticism which is somehow more human, if less easily-browsed, than the rest of the museum. You're surrounded by shelves containing: small shells, coins, shells of moderate size, telescopes, astrolabes, bones, large shells, burial materials of ancient China, Greek vases of inferior quality to those displayed elsewhere, shells large enough to hide inside, and a stuffed monkey.
  
  Somewhere there is probably also the shelf containing animals painted with a fine camel's-hair brush, but you don't see it just now.
  
  You can see the gaunt older gentleman, a blue door and a blue key here.

  Disconcerting Exhibit
  Art and artifacts, but not from any culture you can identify; in fact, the longer you stand at the center of the room the less certain you are that they're even the product of human hands, or tools made for human lives.
  
  One exhibit is an angular flavor. It is feather-light and vibrates with angry disdain at having been captured in this form.
  
  Another is a pair of number colors, four-green and six-red.

  Parthenon Frieze Room
  A tasteful exhibit of the Parthenon sculptures accompanied by plaques explaining why under no circumstances they should be returned to Athens. For the good of humanity, which is of course the Museum's chief concern.

  Disconcerting Exhibit
  Art and artifacts, but not from any culture you can identify; in fact, the longer you stand at the center of the room the less certain you are that they're even the product of human hands, or tools made for human lives.
  
  One exhibit is an angular flavor. It is feather-light and vibrates with angry disdain at having been captured in this form.
  
  Another is a pair of number colors, four-green and six-red.
