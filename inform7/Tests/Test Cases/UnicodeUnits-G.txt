The Kitchen is a room.

A wallet is a kind of value.

1.0 € specifies a wallet.
1.0€ specifies a wallet.

A sign is in the Kitchen.

Check examining the sign:
	let C be 2.0 €;
	now C is C plus 0.5€;
	instead say "Bananas: 2.5 € is [C].";

Counting is an action applying to one wallet.
Understand "count [wallet]" as counting.

Report counting:
	say "You count [the wallet understood]."

Test me with "x sign / count 1.5 € / count 2€ / count 1.0x10^2 € / count 34x10^-1€".
