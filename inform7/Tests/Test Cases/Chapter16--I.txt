  Laundry
  An old Limehouse haunt, the Chinese laundry used by the down-trodden wives of the Tong of the Black Scorpion.
  
  There is nothing obviously oriental about the vast marble sink, which is large enough to lie down inside. A wooden-rack floor, equipped for easy drainage, turns out also to be equipped for snagging the shoes of passers-by.
