The Cocktail Bar is a room. Cocktails are a concept. Party is a concept. The server and Loretta are women in the Cocktail Bar. The bartender, Patrick and Gareth are men in the Cocktail Bar. 

A drink is a kind of thing. A drink can be full or empty. Loretta carries an empty drink called a mai tai. Patrick carries a full drink called the old-fashioned.

A flavour is a kind of value. The flavours are mock, bitter, dry, semi-sweet, and sweet. A drink has a flavour. 

The last-named drink is a drink that varies. The chosen guest is a person that varies. The chosen guest is Loretta.
