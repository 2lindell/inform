Test: TrainStop
For: Z-Machine

Station is a room.
Train Stop is a scene.
Flying Scotsman is a thing.

When play begins:
  now the time of day is 11:57 pm.

When Train Stop begins:
  now the Flying Scotsman is in the Station;
  say "The Flying Scotsman pulls up at the platform, to a billow of steam and hammering."

When Train Stop ends:
  now the Flying Scotsman is nowhere;
  if the player is in the Station, say "The Flying Scotsman inches away, with a squeal of released brakes, gathering speed invincibly until it disappears around the hill. All is abruptly still once more."

Every turn: say time of day.

Train Stop begins when the player is in the Station for the third turn.

Train Stop ends when the time since Train Stop began is 3 minutes.

Test me with "z / z / z / z / z / z".
