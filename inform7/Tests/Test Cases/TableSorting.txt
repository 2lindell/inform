The Plain is a Room.

To view the tableau:
	repeat with n running from 1 to the number of rows in the Table of Funny Numbers begin;
		choose  row n in the Table of Funny Numbers;
		if there is a numeric entry 
		begin;
			let x be the numeric entry;
			say "x is [x].";
		otherwise;
			say "Row [n] is blank!";
		end if;
	end repeat.

Instead of jumping:
	sort the Table of Funny Numbers in numeric order;
	view the tableau.

Instead of waiting:
	sort the Table of Funny Numbers in reverse numeric order;
	view the tableau.

Test me with "wait/jump/wait/wait/jump".
