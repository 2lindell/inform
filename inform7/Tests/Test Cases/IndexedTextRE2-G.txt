The Outer Solar System is a room. [This is traditionally where regular
expression testing takes place, for some reason.]

To test replacing (t1 - text) in (t2 - text):
	test replacing t1 with "!" in t2.

To test replacing (t1 - text) with (t3 - text) in (t2 - text):
	let Neptune be text;
	let Neptune be t2;
	replace the regular expression t1 in Neptune with t3; 
	say "[t2]: replacing [t1] with [t3] --> [Neptune][line break]".

To test matching (t1 - text) in (t2 - text):
	if t2 matches the regular expression t1
	begin;
		say "  matching [t1] in [t2] --> [text matching regular expression][line break]";
	otherwise;
		say "  matching [t1] in [t2] --> --[line break]";
	end if.

To test counting (t1 - text) in (t2 - text):
	let N be the number of times t2 matches the regular expression t1;
	say "counting [t1] in [t2] --> [N] time[s][line break]".

The lower bound is a number that varies. The upper bound is a number that varies.

Century-running is an action applying to a number. Understand "century [number]" as century-running.

Batch-running is an action applying to a number. Understand "batch [number]" as batch-running.

Test-running is an action applying to a number. Understand "run [number]" as test-running.

Test-compiling is an action applying to a number. Understand "compile [number]" as test-compiling.

Alling is an action applying to nothing. Understand "all" as alling.

Carry out alling:
	now lower bound is 1;
	now upper bound is the number of rows in the Table of Perl Test Cases;
	say "Complete test set.";
	repeat with N running from lower bound to upper bound
	begin;
		run single test N;
	end repeat;
	say "Batch complete."

Carry out century-running:
	let B be the number understood times 100;
	now lower bound is B minus 99;
	now upper bound is B;
	say "Batch [number understood]: tests [lower bound] to [upper bound].";
	repeat with N running from lower bound to upper bound
	begin;
		run single test N;
	end repeat;
	say "Batch complete."

Carry out batch-running:
	let B be the number understood times 10;
	now lower bound is B minus 9;
	now upper bound is B;
	say "Batch [number understood]: tests [lower bound] to [upper bound].";
	repeat with N running from lower bound to upper bound
	begin;
		run single test N;
	end repeat;
	say "Batch complete."

Carry out test-running:
	debug mode 1;
	run single test (the number understood);
	debug mode 0.

Carry out test-compiling:
	debug mode 2;
	compile single test (the number understood);
	debug mode 0.

To debug mode (N - a number): (- TEXT_TY_RE_SetTrace({N}); -).
To decide if a regexp error occurred: (- (((TEXT_TY_RE_Err<0) || (TEXT_TY_RE_Err>=32))) -).

To decide what text is regexp error message: (- (TEXT_TY_RE_Err) -).

To say match (N - number):
	say text matching subexpression N.

To say match start pos (N - number):
	(- if (TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},0) >= 0) print TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},0); -).

To say match end pos (N - number):
	(- if (TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},1) >= 0) print TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},1); -).

To test-compile the regular expression (T - text):
	(- TEXT_TY_RE_CompileTree({-by-reference:T});
	if ((TEXT_TY_RE_Err<0) || (TEXT_TY_RE_Err>=32)) print "Error returned: ", (string) TEXT_TY_RE_Err, "^";
	else TEXT_TY_RE_Err = 0;
	-).

To compile single test (N - a number):
	if N is greater than the number of rows in the Table of Perl Test Cases, stop;
	choose row N in the Table of Perl Test Cases;
	if outcome entry is "c",
		say "test [N]: compiling [pattern entry] should produce error [resultant entry].";
	otherwise
		say "test [N]: compiling [pattern entry] should work.";
	test-compile the regular expression pattern entry.

To say casing of (N - a number):
	if N is 1, say "insensitive";
	otherwise say "sensitive".

To say number of rewinds:
	(- TEXT_TY_RE_PrintNoRewinds(); -).

To run single test (N - a number):
	if N is greater than the number of rows in the Table of Perl Test Cases, stop;
	choose row N in the Table of Perl Test Cases;
	if outcome entry is "c"
	begin;
		say "test [N]: compiling [pattern entry] to error [resultant entry] --> ";
	otherwise if outcome entry is "r";

	otherwise;
		say "test [N]: matching [pattern entry] in [target entry] case [casing of insens entry] --> ";
	end if;
	let failure be 0;
	let match be 0;
	let EXP be an text;
	if exactly entry is 1
	begin;
		if insens entry is 1
		begin;
			if target entry exactly matches the regular expression pattern entry, case insensitively
				begin;
				let match be 1;
				let EXP be expand entry;
			end if;
		otherwise;

				begin;
				let match be 1;

			end if;
		end if;
	otherwise;

		begin;

			begin;

				let EXP be expand entry;
			end if;
			end if;

			otherwise;

			begin;
				let match be 1;
				let EXP be expand entry;
			end if;
			end if;
		end if;
	end if;
	let EXP be the substituted form of EXP;
	if a regexp error occurred, let failure be 1;
	otherwise say "<[number of rewinds]> ";
	if outcome entry is "c"
	begin;
		let failure be 1;
		if a regexp error occurred, let failure be 0;
	otherwise if outcome entry is "y";
