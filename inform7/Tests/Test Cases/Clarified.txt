"The Clarified Ancients of Mu Mu"

Lab is a room.

no-clarifications is a truth state that varies.
The no-clarifications variable translates into Inter as "dont_ask_for_clarification".

The red box is a thing in the Lab.
The blue box is a thing in the Lab.

After dropping:
 now no-clarifications is true;
 continue the action.

Test me with "get box / red / drop box / l / get box / i".
