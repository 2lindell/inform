internal file: file of Tall Nettles
1  Tall nettles cover up, as they have done
2  These many springs, the rusty harrow, the plough
3  Long worn out, and the roller made of stone:
4  Only the elm butt tops the nettles now.

6  This corner of the farmyard I like most:
7  As well as any bloom upon a flower
8  I like the dust on the nettles, never lost
9  Except to prove the sweetness of a shower.
