Laboratory
An elegant Pisan room, with fine Renaissance panels, except for the teleport corridor to the east.

You can see a cannon ball and a feather here.

>(Testing.)

>[1] get ball
Taken.

>[2] drop it from 1m
You let go the cannon ball from a height of 1m, and, subject to a downward force of 19.614N, it falls. 45 seconds later, this mass of 2kg hits the floor at 4.42 m/s with a kinetic energy of 19.53J.

>[3] get ball
Taken.

>[4] drop it from 2m
You let go the cannon ball from a height of 2m, and, subject to a downward force of 19.614N, it falls. 63 seconds later, this mass of 2kg hits the floor at 6.26 m/s with a kinetic energy of 39.18J.

>[5] get ball
Taken.

>[6] drop it from 3m
You let go the cannon ball from a height of 3m, and, subject to a downward force of 19.614N, it falls. 78 seconds later, this mass of 2kg hits the floor at 7.67 m/s with a kinetic energy of 58.82J.

This is not doing either the floor or your ears any favours.

>[7] get ball
Taken.

>[8] drop it from 3.2m
Just how tall are you, exactly?

You let go the cannon ball from a height of 3m, and, subject to a downward force of 7.38N, it falls. 1.27s later, this mass of 2kg hits the floor at 4.7 m/s with a kinetic energy of 22.09J.

>[14] drop feather from 3m
You let go the feather from a height of 3m, and, subject to a downward force of 36 Newtons, it falls. 1.25s later, this mass of 10g hits the floor at 4.64 m/s with a kinetic energy of 107mJ.
