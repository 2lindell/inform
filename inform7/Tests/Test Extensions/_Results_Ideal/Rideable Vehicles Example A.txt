  Vehicle Testing Center
  A large square of field surrounded by a wall of hay bales. A driveway leads out to the west. The ground slopes down to a pond along the northern edge.
  
  The sign advertises experimental rides in the following: red wagon, swan, glass elevator and tricycle.
  
  There is a lovely red wagon here, complete with an outboard motor.
  
  At the pond's edge waits a black swan of unusual size, wearing a bridle and a gold-trimmed Mexican hat.
