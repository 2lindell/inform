  Stuffed Room
  Your father's study, a taxidermist's retreat, in which he could withdraw from the noisy, tumultuous presence of the living. Sometimes you would catch him in here walking from object to object, gently rubbing more fur off the balding heads, even once kissing the nose of a formaldehyded moose; which made you doubt whether you could ever compete for his attention, even when standing very very very still.
  
  Your eye is drawn inexplicably to a dingo, about which there hovers, however briefly, a kind of holy significance, a spiritual spotlight. What here can compare: the joey, the iguana, the aardvark, the capybara?
