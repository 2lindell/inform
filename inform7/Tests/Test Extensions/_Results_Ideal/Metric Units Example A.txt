>(Testing.)

>[1] get ball
Taken.

>[2] drop it from 1m
You let go the cannon ball from a height of 1.0m, and, subject to a downward force of 19.614N, it falls. 0.45s later, this mass of 2.0kg hits the floor at 4.42877 m/s with a kinetic energy of 19.614J.

>[3] get ball
Taken.

>[4] drop it from 2m
You let go the cannon ball from a height of 2.0m, and, subject to a downward force of 19.614N, it falls. 0.64s later, this mass of 2.0kg hits the floor at 6.26323 m/s with a kinetic energy of 39.228J.

>[5] get ball
Taken.

>[6] drop it from 3m
You let go the cannon ball from a height of 3.0m, and, subject to a downward force of 19.614N, it falls. 0.78s later, this mass of 2.0kg hits the floor at 7.67085 m/s with a kinetic energy of 58.842J.

This is not doing either the floor or your ears any favours.

>[7] get ball
Taken.

>[8] drop it from 3.2m
