  Bridge
  Beneath this long, narrow bridge is a gully full of ice-water from the mountains above. It runs milky at this time of year, and is not fit to drink. The air off it is bitterly cold. Just north of here is the Roman watchtower, built square and still defensible despite several centuries of neglect.
  
  You can see Leif here.

  Shivering and fumbling, you manage to unlock the tower door with the large iron key. Your fingers are very nearly numb.
  
  The tower door resists your first shove or two, but then falls open.
  
  Watchtower
  The wooden floor has mostly rotted away, exposing the square pit in which the paymaster used to keep the soldiers' coin. It is possible to move around the perimeter of the room without falling in, however.

  Leif gives the tower door several shoves before managing to open it.
  
  Leif goes north.
